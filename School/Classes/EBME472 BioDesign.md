## Reading 1.1-1.2
Find challenges + problems in current practice that impose a significant burden (often financial)
### 1.1 Strategic Focus
Strategic Focus: Align personal values + skills w/ characteristics of focus area 
- Found after establishing acceptance criteria from personal inventory + external factors

Personal inventory: determine strengths/weaknesses + mission 
- Find achievable + engaging projects
Mission: very context dependent but needs to be defined 
Strengths + weaknesses: how to leverage + and compensate for 
External factors: funding, regulatory --> how much risk to assume

Defining your acceptance criteria *before* looking at projects makes it easier to evaluate them with an established standard

Could some effort have been made to disseminate the information discovered in the ExploraMed example or pass it along to companies/orgs that could tackle the problems better

Consider geography as well: market size, patient impact, healthcare systems for people to pay for treatments

Ethics
- Fiduciary duty: legally responsible for spending investors money, has to be considered as a stakeholder
- Beachump and Childress 4 principles of medical ethics
	- Focus on patient / participant but what about doctor as well

### 1.2 Needs Exploration 

Need itself, population, desired outcome - result if prob is solved

Techniques
- Background research
	- Disease state, existing solutions, stakeholders, market factors
	- Consider all perspectives in cycle of care
	- Avoiding bias in questions 
- Observations
	- Issues should be recurring cases of doubt, uncertainty, difficulty, inadequacy, undue cost
	- Validate *all assumptions* to determine true need
	- Access via network, clinician partner, cold call
	- Observe entire timeline of care
	- Establishing empathy
	- Keeping an open mind + curbing assumptions 
	- Repeat observations to account for variability 
	- Look for signs: pain, inefficiency, cost, stress, uncertainty, *dogma*, info gaps
	- Notes
		- Do them during or soon after observing
		- Only what is seen, don't interpret 
		- Note facts, details, people there, timing, insider language, comments from the team, follow up questions 
		- "Marry the problem not the solution"
- Interviews
	- Synthesize observations without valuing one over the others
	- Note confusing or contradictory observations for follow up 
	- Tailor questions to the interviewee's perspective 
	- Don't say "usually" - rather "tell me about a time ..."
	- Don't suggest answers to a question
	- Avoid yes/no questions
	- Document!
Continue a phase until new ideas slow or patterns emerge

Increasing emphasis on maximizing economic value
- Closely examine standard of care for areas of potential improvement 
- Budget-based signposts - dig into financial records 
- Reimbursement penalties represent a motivator for hospitals to improve care

Understand cultural norms to build rapport
Understand the environment to observe the right areas: is there a lot of variety, which people are critical to the standard of care, levels of comfort with devices, level of access for an observer , comfort with or barriers to medical devices

Hi, my name is Eileen (she/her) and I'm a second year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering.  Currently, planning to continue in academia and pursue continued research paired with teaching.  I'm from Elmhurst, IL right outside of Chicago and also did my undergrad at CWRU in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science.  In this class, I am interested in learning from different perspectives on BioDesign beyond an engineering mindset.  I also want to learn about how new medical technologies are funded in the development phase and beyond as solutions are scaled up.
