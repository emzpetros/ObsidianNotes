With Case: 8.25, 16.25

  

The upper clip only has to be moved in the Z axis to fit the portrait width of your phone.

The lower clip needs adjusting to your particular air vent design and the length of the long part of the clip adjusted to fit the phone's landscape height up to the upper clip. The separation between the lower clips is: a snug fit in the air vent, but not so far apart the phone falls through(!)
