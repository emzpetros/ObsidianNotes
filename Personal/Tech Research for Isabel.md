Features

- HR
- SP02
- Not google / amazon / evil companies (Apple okay)
- Doesn’t need to have onboard GPS
- Doesn’t need to have smartwatch like features with phone notifications and such

  

General

- Look at fitness bands vs trackers or watches or watches with minimal features
- If you can do without SP02 there’s other options like the Garmin Vivofit 4

  

Products

- I gave up writing out all the Vivomove models so here they are in a [table](https://smartshopping.guide/articles/garmin-vivomove-model-comparison): main relevant difs are some features, size, colors, price
