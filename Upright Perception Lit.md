- Plantar afferent info attenuated w/ foam or stimulated w/ inserts
- Symmetry / asymmetry of signals may be informing perception

[[ardicSubjectiveVisualVertical2023]]
- Consider headset weight + controller positioning 
- Small deviations 

[[anastasopoulosRoleSomatosensoryInput1999]]
- Role of somatosensory sensation 
- Tilt of subject about naso-occipital axis (roll plane)
- Particiapnt could adjust target line + cabin
- Set the line so it appears vertical 
- Somatosensory loss only playing a role in body tilt, not upright 
- "Mild to mod unilateral sensory loss not enough to bias" 


[[kavounoudiasFootSoleAnkle2001]]
- Backward body tilt from forefoot vibration 
- Latency of proprio stim > tactile: different fiber types?, more processing?
- Greater postural response to low freq tactile and high freq proprio 
- Vibration acting as a surrogate to "pressure increase due to body tilt"
	- Similar results using transcutaneous electrical stim
- Tactile input theorized to regulate small body sways
- Diener et al 1984 ischemic block of afferents at ankle only impeded postural response at small amplitude, low freq support changes
- Integration theory favored 

[[dienerSignificanceProprioceptionPostural1984]]
- Could not keep thigh level ischemia for long periods of time
