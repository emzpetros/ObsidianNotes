[[ardicSubjectiveVisualVertical2023]]
- Consider headset weight + controller positioning 
- Small deviations 

- Role of somatosensory sensation 
- Tilt of subject about naso-occipital axis (roll plane)
- Particiapnt could adjust target line + cabin
- Set the line so it appears vertical 
- Somatosensory loss only playing a role in body tilt, not upright 
- "Mild to mod unilateral sensory loss not enough to bias"
