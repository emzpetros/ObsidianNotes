# Data Processing

Event A = PWS

Event B = SP

# DFlow

Mark when SP speed is reached

Mark when treadmill start and stop command is sent

Slider to change increment: 0.05, 0.1

Up and down speed buttons

  

Start at 0.2, 1.6 for fast

SP: 1.0 m/s, 5 mins , fixed sens at 1.0

# Notes

Determining preferred walking speed

Vars: SNP + intensity (low, medium, high)

  

  

Gap between SP (actual) and FP (perceived) walking speed shrinks

  

Markers: no arms

  

- Couple minutes of SP preferred walking
- Couple minutes of FP preferred walking: start low and increase
    - Start faster and go slower
    - Change of 0.5 or 1.0
    - 6 total
    - 30 seconds at plateau
    - Put arm markers back on for fixed paced
- Randomize intensity

  

SNP Off first

  

Change intensity: PA

  

Outcome measures:

- gait symmetry
- WB angular momentum : stability
- Center of mass work - efficiency
    - Future work with gas analyzer
    - COM power = Force x COM velocity: integrate graph to get work
    - COm work is negative pushing into ground, + on push off

  

Look at adding EMG data as well

- Add EMG channels

  

DFLOW application

  

Hyptoh

- LLA with sensory feedback, gap of perceived and actual walking speed will be less
- COM work reduced
