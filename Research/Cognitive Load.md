Increased gait variability has been described as a risk factor for falls in elderly participants as well as in participants with neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Parkinsonâ€™s disease [40,41]). Gait variability has also been shown to be influenced by cognitive load [42,43]. In the case of people with a LLA, it might be speculated that the more participants need to focus their attention on gait due to the impairment which is expressed by increased gait variability, perhaps indicative of cognitive deficits [16].
