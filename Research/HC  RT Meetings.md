	- Computer vision: get syllabus 
	- The goal of computer vision is to create visual systems that recognize objects and recover structures in complex 3D scenes. This course emphasizes both the science behind our understanding of the fundamental problems in vision and the engineering that develops mathematical models and inference algorithms to solve these problems. Specific topics include feature detection, matching, and classification; visual representations and dimensionality reduction; motion detection and optical flow; image segmentation; depth perception, multi-view geometry, and 3D reconstruction; shape and surface perception; visual scene analysis and object recognition. Offered as CSDS 465 and ECSE 465.
	- Computational neuroscience - not doing modeling

# 10/11/23 Pre NEC
Some metric of gait changing with task difficulty  

Maybe had to do fixed paced experiment to consider 
- Propose for committee 

Control of narrative 

Our analysis does not suggest a change in gait variability but proposing a new experiment 

one or two slides where I'm going 

Gait did not worsen even rxn time went up
- Maintaining level of stability 
- Not expecting a significant difference 

Present issues (high variance), may need a new experiment that's okay 

metrics are linked to the increase in gait speed, may have to investigate that as well 

# 9/25/23 RT

# 8/21/23 HC

To Do

- Prioritization plan
    - Prioritize cognitive task
    - Does sensation change threshold of automicity in walking
        - Somehow provides input into that circuitry
    - What he was doing before was fine, before no explicit focus
        - Getting more specific , get as many right as possible
    - Only change prioritization
- CWM: baseline processing
    - Need to do able bodied collection
    - Not only does automicity threshold depend on speed but also on the presence of a cognitive task
    - Run stats again: SNP x difficulty
    - Another LE06 session?
        - If instruction makes a difference then run with LE06?
- SVV
    - Another set on and off, with same parameters
    - 3 sets with slightly higher intensity ON: increase PA
        - try and get 2x on the reported sensation
    - Print the foot drawings
    - 0 to infinity what do you rate it : don’t limit to 10
        - draw where felt
        - Rate overall sensation despite movement of sensation
    - Replication description of sensation between sensations
    
- Fellowship courses: where to turn in form SIS

  

Give Hannah 3 hrs for hers : 9-12, 12-1, 1-2

Wed: Suzhou 9-11, Eileen, lunch, Lindsey

  

LE04 SVV

  

Training on hardware issues

- Explain things to people
- Troubleshooting beyond just restarting

  

Reach out on Slack to Srikanth

  

Consider LE01 for Tuesday ? test trial to see how he feels

- If no time then, see when he is available

  

CoM velocity symmetry or smth for pst vs int

- Bringing in step time and such brings in questions such as stance time that we don’t want
- CoM velocity do first

I normally just use the com data from visual3d  
1:57  
And take the first difference.

# 7/24/23

Updates

- Follow up on website
- Interpretation of speed up
- Issue with GRF

Highlight it’s a complete data set

- This many sessions , trials, each condition has this many trials

Question the number, data collection, design

defend against making it harder: there are graded difficulties within in

- RT confirms difficulty
- Should see some difficulty effect even between what may be easier tasks

Effect of sensory neuroprosthesis on cognitive load and gait:

- Presenting on research results vs a lecture

  

Upright Perception

- Start data collection, apply for a bit of money to expand the work
- Move into MOOG
- Head tilt disrupts the input
- What the exp looks like
    - Recap of original exp
    - Distances from subject, dark room
    - X number of trials , each lasts this long; break; sensation
- Sitting
- Stim as input to nervous system
    - More direct control
    - 3 / x # of contacts that elicit sensation
    - Find parameters to make intensity the same
    - Ball, mid, heel parts of the foot
    - Cycle through them
- Does plantar input contribute to the perception of verticality
    - Does peripheral affect
- Could also target different intensity: dif fiber types
- Sync stim onset with start of each trial
- Alternating blocks or randomized
- Seated or resting feet up? Foam under feet to prevent normal mechanical interaction
    - Lifting provides input via joints as well
    - Prevent tapping on foot, heel dig into ground

Data

- Middle strides, outliers

  

Send R21 to Hamid when it’s done

# 6/22/23

LE06

Variation, use median  
if mean is good representative of each trial, done analysis with both - not a lot of difference  
no reason to believe mean is not representative

Use the middle 12 strides

- Mean settled
- Subset of strides TBD

Outcomes:

WBAM:  
GRF:

No SNP effect, stimulus type effect for m outcome measures

- Speed increase with difficulty with incongruent

Meet with Daekyoo

Change with Step Length + Stance time sym in other paper

- Baseline walking: on + off compare

Mean plots only, subset of strides  
Do WBAM, GRF  
Put together slides that tell a story : what my interpretation is, what do they think ; develop something so people can follow

Baseline

How to explain this study vs DK  
Baseline cmparision  
Subset of stridesWBAM, GRFs  
discussion: speed increase w/ IC

Lit search: amputees, amy bastian, leah bent - other populations work, elderly people, rospopovich - be on top of it for conferences + committee

- prior work with amputees
- prior work with other pops DT
- Self vs fixed paced walking
- How many people reported speed increase doing this type of task
- Differences in task design vs typical stroop task
- What they report on cognitive score, range: point to for range no effect, low or high

Back up argument  
Prove it is challenging enough

Challenges of making task harder : three different levels instead of just making it harder with new change

- Increasing challenge without making them lose their gait pattern

Mimic real life situation + SNP's effects on it : while they can maintian normal walking, what happens to walking dynamic

- Defend vs making it harder

Why our binary approach is better, look systematically what is happening

BACK UP EVERYTHING : all parts of tasks, it captures what we want

DK : baseline was 0.5

- SNP effect may be diminished at faster speeds ?

Also look at same day effects,  
DT over time, learning; changes across sessions

---

Aasef, add lab

---

Simple proof of concept, show it works here  
Present design, show we have logistics set up already  
tactors + control system

# Updates

- Look at WBAM
- Look at gait algo for LE01
- Abstract for dual task
- Look at early, mid, late sections

Maybe issue is task vs no task in lit compared to task vs task

- LE02 11/19: all task based times are faster than walking alone with stim on or off

Class Options

- 421 Bioelectric Phenomena: Durand, Laurita: web/distance
    - The goal of this course is to provide working knowledge of the theoretical methods that are used in the fields of electrophysiology and bioelectricity for both neural and cardiac systems. These methods will be applied to describe, from a theoretical and quantitative perspective, the electrical behavior of excitable cells, the methods for recording their activity and the effect of applied electrical and magnetic fields on excitable issues. A team modeling project will be required. Recommended preparation: differential equations, circuits.
- Grant Writing II:
- ANAT 414 Neruological Anatomy: Crofton
    - This course employs a variety of teaching-learning methods--among them lectures, small-group discussions, hands-on "construction" of pathways, and brain dissection. Regional morphology will be studied via examination of the preserved brain and of sections through the CNS; functional systems will be "followed" through the spinal cord, brain stem and/or forebrain.
- Neur 473: intro to neurobiology
    - How nervous systems control behavior. Biophysical, biochemical and molecular biological properties of nerve cells, their organization into circuitry, and their function within networks. Emphasis on quantitative methods for modeling neurons and networks, and on critical analysis of the contemporary technical literature in the neurosciences. Term paper required for graduate students. This course satisfies a lab requirement for the B.A. in Biology, and a Quantitative Laboratory requirements for the B.S. in Biology. Offered as BIOL 373, BIOL 473, and NEUR 473.
- PSCL 401: Phsiological Psychology : Heath Demaree
    - This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of neural communication and central nervous system structure. Special attention is placed on common neurological illnesses and their psychopharmacological treatments. Neural systems underlying sensory/perceptual, motor, and higher-order cognitive processes are also explored. Offered as PSCL 352 and PSCL 403.
- Principles of Neuro Science
    - Lecture/discussion course covering concepts in cell and molecular neuroscience, principles of systems neuroscience as demonstrated in the somatosensory system, and fundamentals of the development of the nervous system. This course will prepare students for upper level Neuroscience courses and is also suitable for students in other programs who desire an understanding of neurosciences. Recommended preparation: CBIO 453. Offered as [**BIOL 402**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=BIOL%20402) and [**NEUR 402**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=NEUR%20402).

**BIOL 422. Sensory Biology. 3 Units.**

The task of a sensory system is to collect, process, store, and transmit information about the environment. How do sensory systems convert information from the environment into neural information in an animal's brain? This course will explore the ecology, physiology, and behavior of the senses across organisms. We will cover introductory neurobiology and principles of sensory system organization before delving more deeply into vision, olfaction, audition, mechanosensation, and multi-modal sensory integration. For each sensory modality, we will consider how the sensory system operates and how its operation affects the organism's behavior and ecology. We will also explore the evolution of sensory systems and their specialization for specific behavioral tasks. Offered as [**BIOL 322**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=BIOL%20322) and [**BIOL 422**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=BIOL%20422). Counts as SAGES Departmental Seminar. Prereq: Graduate standing.

**NEUR 474. Neurobiology of Behavior. 3 Units.**

In this course, students will examine how neurobiologists interested in animal behavior study the linkage between neural circuitry and complex behavior. Various vertebrate and invertebrate systems will be considered. Several exercises will be used in this endeavor. Although some lectures will provide background and context on specific neural systems, the emphasis of the course will be on classroom discussion of specific journal articles. In addition, students will each complete a project in which they will observe some animal behavior and generate both behavioral and neurobiological hypotheses related to it. In lieu of examinations, students will complete three written assignments, including a theoretical grant proposal, a one-page Specific Aims paper related to the project, and a final project paper. These assignments are designed to give each student experience in writing biologically-relevant documents. Classroom discussions will help students understand the content and format of each type document. They will also present their projects orally to the entire class. Offered as [**BIOL 374**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=BIOL%20374), [**BIOL 474**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=BIOL%20474) and [**NEUR 474**](https://bulletin.case.edu/search/?P=NEUR%20474). Counts as SAGES Departmental Seminar.

Example: **Argus Science_ETVision & Argus Science ET3Space**  
:  The use of eye tracking technology has become popular in rehabilitation research across various patient populations such as people who have suffered stroke, those with vestibular disorder, and individuals with limb loss. Such devices are extremely useful in determining focus of participants’ attention during a task. Moreover, the data acquired with these devices give insight into the cognitive processes, and can reveal how much users rely on their visual input to perform a task. The **ETVision system**  
 provides precise, binocular eye measurement, with the ultimate in ease of use and complete mobility indoors or out. The system is commonly used in research projects and is conceived to allow the investigators to capture data in multiple ways. This system will allow us to probe effectiveness of technology developed by APT investigator in ways that were not possible before. The functionality of this system could be further improved if it is integrated into the motion capture system installed in the Motion Study Lab. As such, an additional module **ET3Space**  
 is required to provide seamless integration into existing data acquisition system in the Motion Study Lab.

Room-scale VR and full body tracking equipment: Virtual reality (VR) is a unique tool to simulate life-like scenarios in a controlled manner. For our work, it would enable investigation of how restored sensation impacts complex cortical processes during locomotion for example navigating crowded environments. A VR setup for this purpose requires high end hardware so the simulation is immersive (Vive headset, Index controllers). For unencumbered locomotion, additional tracking hardware is required (Steam VR base stations, Vive wireless adaptor). Finally, to visualize a person’s as a full body avatar additional trackers are required (Vive trackers). Altogether these devices enable the delivery of detailed virtual reality devices at room-scale. The user’s location and full body movements can be tracked. Additionally, the headset is capable of mixed reality with front facing cameras and the controllers allow for individual finger tracking.

Justification

Virtual reality (VR) is a compelling tool for use in research for its ability to make realistic scenarios that are controllable to a fine degree of detail. However, VR is typically limited to seated experiences or at most the size of the room you are in. The Infinadeck multidirectional treadmill is a unique piece of hardware that allows unlimited movement while in virtual reality in a self contained package. Users can walk and even jog in any direction while maintaining a natural gait. Entire virtual spaces can be explored in this way. This capability introduces the possibility of examining gait in more complex and true to life scenarios. Furthermore, this movement is accomplished without minimal additional equipment.

The device has robust software support so existing applications could be quickly transferred to the system. It already has integration with existing motion capture hardware such as Optitrack and Vicon support could be added. No other hardware solution offers the same level of locomotion in VR.

  

cutting-edge technology that allows for an unparalleled virtual reality experience, and its use in lower limb amputee research has the potential to revolutionize the field. There are several justifications for a research lab to purchase the Infinadeck treadmill for virtual reality experiments with lower limb amputees:

1. Realistic, immersive experience: The Infinadeck treadmill provides an immersive virtual reality experience that closely simulates real-world walking, which is essential for lower limb amputees who need to retrain their motor skills. By walking on the Infinadeck, amputees can experience a variety of terrains, slopes, and obstacles, which will allow them to practice walking in a safe and controlled environment.
2. Improved gait analysis: The Infinadeck treadmill is equipped with motion capture technology that can provide accurate gait analysis data in real-time. This will allow researchers to track the progress of lower limb amputees and make adjustments to their prosthetics and therapy accordingly. With this technology, researchers can better understand the biomechanics of walking and develop more effective rehabilitation strategies.
3. Cost-effective: While the Infinadeck treadmill is a significant investment, it is also a cost-effective option compared to other traditional gait analysis tools. It can replace the need for multiple pieces of equipment, such as motion capture cameras, force plates, and other gait analysis devices. Additionally, it reduces the need for frequent patient visits and long-term care, saving time and money for both patients and healthcare providers.
4. Ethical considerations: Infinadeck's unique technology allows for lower limb amputees to participate in studies without the need for a prosthesis, which can be a painful and time-consuming process. By using the Infinadeck, researchers can perform studies on amputees without the need for them to wear their prosthetic limb, thus reducing potential pain or injury risks and improving patient comfort.

In conclusion, the Infinadeck treadmill is an innovative technology that can improve the rehabilitation process for lower limb amputees. Its realistic and immersive virtual reality experience, motion capture technology, cost-effectiveness, and ethical considerations make it an essential tool for research labs focused on lower limb amputee rehabilitation.

Agenda

- Updates: new PC is in!
- Dual task data:
    - Why the speed up ????
- New lab computer !
- PWS data
- A perimeter’s and then the only one so I did a bunch of time I had calculated confession of variance a while back but now just statistically checking how they compared so this is a I think it’s a single single ratio test that was verified to Fort for variance, even with berries small sample sizes so I was using it for this because by the time I calculate all the coefficients there’s not that much there per one, but there were basically no differences between. I didn’t soon. Love you between like I did all of the stem on all the SIM off regardless of tasks no difference in variation and then group all of the task so all the time you’re doing stripped all the time you’re doing read regards to stimulation also novation and then I did within it say we only have stem on. Let’s compare now between reading and doing Stroup him off so did this for all of earlier too, and Elliot far as well and they were none of them came up except this one here which is the stem on condition for LM to there is a difference between red and he was doing reading or strip in one session test of basically essentially T test for difference between coefficient of variance instead of C mean so result of these comes out in these P values. If it’s less than .05 then we will check to know about this is that they are saying, so this was the only one they came out in between all the other conditions all the others there is essentially no difference in variance Upcoming submission deadlines

NSF Agenda

- Applying this year for sure: publication record?
    - 1st author paper in review
    - Experimental protocol, data collection
    - Suzhou, Hannah, Evan applied w/o papers
        - Talk to them about their feedback
- Clarifying the overall goal + aims: specificity
- Hertz: only 1st year
- If it comes down to pushing yourself do it now
    - Rejection comes down to idea vs “not enough research”
- NSF about IM + BI:
    - Innovation, broader impact
    - More than just amputees : maybe apply it to others, or just start here

Magic Leap

- Work into thesis aims
- Possible funding sources??

  

Make the goal broader:

- not as technical
- How plantar sensation contributes to locomotion
    - For example, amputees have lower limb sensiormotor impairment
- Open question how this plantar sensation contributes to locomotion: motor adaptation and gait patterns
    - Peripheral nerve stim in general
    - We have a system that can input to peripheral nerve stim, can elicit sensation from missing limb
    - Had impact on stability, balance, symmetry
- How how the information from peripheral nerves are integrated into CNS
- Different angles
    - One example is cognitive task and circuitry
    - Build significance for lack of this information
- Don’t sell as tech for amputees: selling it as a model
    - Can directly change inputs into PNS and see how it affects!
    - BTw can help with amputation
- Make the story not about C-FINE, SNP, amputee
- **sensation from foot, how does it interact with brain**
    - Technology serves as model for this question
    - Peripheral nervous system input into CNS
- Keep it open
    - Start with dual tasking
    - New gait pattern learning
    - go into obstacle crossing!!
    - Augmentation
    - Stroke, MS applications

  

Not limited by amputation population + C-FINE tech: too narrow

  

Hypothesis

- Go into specific experiments now as aims / hypothesis
- Plantar sensation will reduce cognitive load as evidenced by performance during dual task walking, outcome measures of gait stability / symmetry , cognitive score
- Hypoth: “elicited” plantar sensation will
    - Some sensation through peripheral nerve: some input, this will apply
        - I can tell you how it will affect motor learning, adaptation, motor planning (crowd walking)
    - New sensation
    - More technology agnostic: use surface stim or Utah
- Then talk about approach: as a model, amputees can apply peripheral nerve stim via SNP
- **This technology is the model, but approach + knowledge gained can be applicable to variety of conditions + technology is agnostic**
    - No specific neural interface
    - I will determine interaction of that input + what’s happening in brain

  

Brain imaging: FNIRs, EEG

- Aim 1: characterize interactions of provided plantar sensation + locomotion circuitry

  

Hypotheses: We hypoth that brain activity associated with … will increase or resemble that of able bodied

- Intervention to approach able-bodied
- ___ areas will be more active as seen in non-invasive methods with FNIRs / EEG

  

Need to develop other aspects

- Brain imaging
- In addition to DT, crowd walking

  

Aims: clear words

- Develop, characterize, determine
- Develop VR / AR environment suitable for testing crowd walking
    - Platform
- Don’t have to tie to a specific experiment
- Determine effects of plantar sensation on brain activity : imaging, gait outcomes
- Characterize: subjective reports, difficulty, balance confidence
    - During cognitive tasks
- Don’t have to be equal proportions of the work
- Be independent of each other: don’t say develop, test, validate for each
    - Assess interactions
    - //
    - Not directly dependent
    - Contingency plan: if VR doesn’t work, have a plan B so that assessment can take place without development if needed

  

Identify what you like to write

- Want to say “motor planning + sensation not known”
- Know what you want to say and then develop it
- Skim through papers to have an idea of what’s done
- Background will take a while (day)

  

Best suited to do it because of this model availability, and I have knowledge

- Expert for locomotor neural science
- Nice environment: access to facilities

Don’t take stuff out, how you highlight it

- Don’t get hung up on C-FINE
- Some will reject out of hand

Clarify to reviewer: crazy stuff has been done already, bigger picture view

- Just do no SNP trials
- Have a plan B
- Can ask Hannah to do some thresholding + adjust parameters: adds another half hour
- Otherwise schedule for next time
- Only sciatic cuff
- Is latest threshold data on Teams : check for responses

Next week start using ASCU

- Use UECU with LE01 + 2 to learn the process then move to ASCU

Responsible for putting it on

- Woodstock, zip-ties
- Verify UECU output with oscilloscope
- Check LED when he goes back on treadmill: make sure its Stim ON!
    - Could accidently turn whole unit off

  

Develop a To Do list for items + processes : scissors, cable, fanny pack, data on drive etc.

- Experiment is more than running implementation, do Stim

  

Our job to remove system: insole, zip-tie, put it all back

- AA is charged, UECU is charged

  

  

Baseline measures + SNP adjustment

- 5 mins of just walking at self-paced
    - Can cut it down to 2-3 after a bit
- 3 blocks each: 1st block will have learning effects, may analyze spearate

  

Breaks for > 10 mins of walking

# 8-9

Dual Task

- Shrunk words back
- Added ability to show each color option
- Do we want to attempt randomizing the individual trials? How would we process the data for that
- Data Analysis: working on Vicon

LE04

- Self paced walking: preferred speed, walk a bit, switch (but don’t say when)
    - May have to change sensitivity
- See how moving word back changes things
- Slightly faster interval than what they say is comfortable
- Instructions:
    - Disregard missed words, how to resume
    - Do your best, but prioritize both, not going for perfect
- Self-paced alternative: 3 speed levels

  

Paper

  

Data Processing

- Establishing pipelines: voice, video data
- Worth going through Vicon data: what can be extracted
- Automating, allowing for delegation
- What should we expect with fixed speed
    - What else should we be looking at
    - May see some trends
    - May be a plateau in the data
- Time it

  

ASCU: ASCU, shell based interface

- Moving to it for self contained SNP
- not doing low level programming

## To Do

- [ ] Combined VStroop and AStroop block
- [ ] Criteria for flubbed / late answers
- [ ] Bug with repeated words
- [ ] Think of self-paced alternative ideas
- [ ] Think about splitting up work
- [ ] LE04: marker placement
- [x] Check if phone audio can be heard , yes!
- [ ] List what we need to verify / check on Thursday
- [ ] Plan time: 30 min prep, 30 min protocl testing (if it goes well, counts as data collection)
    - [ ] Try changing sensitivity
    - [ ] Data as tuning data
    - [ ] And who we need to help
- [ ] Take notes as it’s going
- [ ] Look into UECU Simulink model too
- [ ] ASCU: under Teams, Tutorials, let rachel mahn? know if there’s any issues
    - SNP standalone only, not real time

  

Remove SNP: woodstock, insole, wires disconnect from orange, fanny pack

Make sure SNP is on vs off

Turn off stim and unit, detach cables

- Securing cable securely around markers

  

  

  

  

# Stand alone

UECU Lite: 12 channels

SL → stanelaone

On r drive

LMTTOOL: stop and start server

If not working

- Under C:/UECU
- Ram hex file first
- Then hello hex
- Restart after each

Green = stim on / select

Red = stim off / back

White = cycle through options

Power: press and hold to turn off (Screen flashes), press once to turn on, again to start loaded program

Test stim with test board: should see PW change when applying pressure to corresponding area

  

Betwixt subjs: change params file and file name in pre-load settings of model (restart MATLAB for changes to take effect)

  

Troubleshooting:

- Correct COM port for program
- Not running multiple instances of ULoad
- Battery has power
- Perc board connections are secure

# 4-5

- Oculus Quest: love hate, more development to go
    - Tried boxing game: supernatural
    - Weight can be an issue
    - Lack of tactile feedback beyond vibration in controllers
- Weight and right fit
- TAing on first semester
    - Spread out TAing a bit
    - What are the PhD requirements
    - pros vs cons of now vs later
    - Cell Bio class 1st semester: too demanding of a class
- Optimize time + activities
    - Gain something for later
    - Show cross platform in CS
    - Chair of dept cares for faculty jobs that you can teach more than one thing
    - Get something out of it extra
- Class registration
    - Cell bio, Capadona prof development
- When to be here for the summer

  

IRB should approve late april/sometime in May

- If I need time off, take it
- Work a month or two
- Set up paper work for in between summer time

  

- IMU
    - Calibrating with camera seems to be working
    - Trying to print a holder for it

  

- Action Items
    - See if CS stuff counts for TA requirement
    - NSF this or next fall
    - Set up weekly meetings w/ Hamid; Ron joins monthly
    - Chronic stability paper: would count for graduation
        - Get submitted by end of summer
        - 2 first author, 1 co; 2 conference presentation
    - Request Joseph D Bennett if you need access to R drive or Will Rasper
        - Study folder Triolo 90 (implant study) or 38 Relinc
    - Teams:
        
          
        

Update: found a way to calibrate the IMU direction using a known vector

Next Three Weeks:

- Improving the comfort of the VR (Hamid been doing some usability tests): looking at a 3D printed counterweight
- Looking at some papers, other experiment possibilities

  

# 3-23

- MSL recap
- Lab cleaning
    - Bringing the Quest back
    - What has to be cleaned out of the cubicle: just remove everything
- Summer plans?
    - Not pushing as much w/ me in the program
    - VR small experiments while developing the motor control
    - Include Dr Shaik + others later to combine things later on
- IMU calibration
    - Use headset to calibrate initial
    - Mounting it to headset: clip it to headset + knee joint
    - Open one up: how attached the housing is to the electronics
- Paper: visual perturbation
- April 5th meeting: move to wed, thurs, friday

# 3-8

Agenda

- MSL presentation: last had the blocky ankle, HC’s MSL update
    - 15 mins: Sensory meeting slides
    - Focus on overview of project + goals
    - Development of VR: IMU
    - Identify challenges faced in VR
    - Don’t think problems you’re working on are super simplistic:
        - Foot movement through ground: raise level
    - Implement joint + prosthetic dynamics
        - Not doing it actively now but joint has certain range of motion + stiffness + set boundary
        - Set coefficients so it can be modeled
    - Musculo skeletal model of ankle or knee joint: implement dynamics into Unity
        - How are you modeling limb movement
        - Naturalistic limb movement could be modeled in VR or Unity
    - Change dynamics of prosthesis
    - **Would like to work with for PhD**
        - Shaped by my interests + motivations
        - Push me to come up with ideas
        - Crowd walking ideas
        - Define own project + go wild
- Grad School:
    - Rochester visit
    - deadline on fellowship for CWRU: school or dept scholarship
- IMU Work:
    - Connectable to PC based application
    - Will need to work on Android part
        - Either swap out the build with a plugin
        - Or cross communicate between two apps
        - Is a direct quaternion best to map a rotation?

Notes:

try shank placement: near knee and near end of stump

Keep Shaik on committee not as advisor

IMU paper: mini project - detect gait events based on wearables

- Knowing where in gait cycle emg comes from
- Use off the shelf algos and hardware if possible

**Send draft of slides a couple days before**
