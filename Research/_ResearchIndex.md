# DOD

Team, following up on my request from the sensory meeting: please send me your paragraph updates by tomorrow COB, so I can include them in the upcoming DoD report. (It’s ok if it is more than a paragraph, but keep it high level). It should follow this format: 1) what is the general description of what you did (did experiment xx or yy, or contacted people, or submitted things to IRB) 2) Why you did it (what was the goal to be achieved and why that goal is important) 3) what came of it (we observed xxxx or we collected EMG data or we sent people brochures) 4) what’s coming next (completing the data analysis, collecting more data, following up with people)

Be concise but provide useful information. Don’t say you did an experiment and data collection is underway.

And one last thing: don’t be shy, state what you think describes your effort, remember that this is not a journal paper, it’s to show DoD we are actively working on the project (which is the truth but they will not know it till we tell them what has been done)

  

  

  

My work has consisted of technical development for a virtual reality (VR) simulator for an ankle prosthesis. The goal of this project is for a user to use EMG input to control a virtual representation of a real life myoelectric prosthesis. The advantage of this simulator is that the myoelectric control scheme can be decoupled from the physical prosthesis. This separation can allow for more accessible training for users new to myoelectric control as well as a platform to test new control schemes in a standardized, reproducible environment.

Thus far a VR environment has been created where a seated user can see their virtual lower body, and the virtual ankle can flex up and down in response to surface EMG signals from an able-bodied user. The user can also interact with simple environmental objects (buttons, bouncing balls) using handheld controllers. For VR I am using an Oculus Quest 2 headset and controllers. In addition to a functional VR environment, I have established a communication method between the VR hardware and existing lab equipment with MATLAB-based software using UDP networking. With the basic software and hardware in place, future work will consist of refining the control law used to translate EMG signal to the virtual ankle movement, as well as improving the VR environment to make it user friendly and capable of running experiments within it.

  

  

  

From a user perspective, the finished simulator could allow amputees to train for myoelectric devices before the device itself is available to them. A completely virtual environment also has the potential to motivate this training with enhanced feedback in a gamification framework. Finally, the simulator could also contribute to the development of myoelectric control schemes by providing a standardized, repeatable environment for testing.
