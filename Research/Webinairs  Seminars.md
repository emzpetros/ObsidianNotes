General limb loss challenges
Further challenges for transfemoral 
Neural interface: high density cuffs, SNP
- Characterize percepts 
IM electrodes

Aims
- Dif in neural interface for transfemoral
	- Previous work intraneural
	- Found TF was higher 
	- Toe, midfoot, heel locations for SNP
	- New method of quantifying intensity: hard to compare between participants 
		- Use intact limb as reference 
		- Old method: increasing intensity w/ charge density 
		- Varying range of intensities per participant 
- Influence of restored sensation on residual limb muscle activity: plantar + referred proprio
	- Hypoth: either / both will lead to increased magnitude + control of EMG during various motions
	- Knee + ankle joint sensations possible 
	- Exp: move missing knee or ankle + record EMG from IMs
		- Use those signals to modulate sensation : plantar and knee/ankle
- EMG control
	- Locomotion modes, gait phase
	- Myoelectric control preffered
	- Challenges: gait mode / terrain changes, falls, trips
		- Physical + mental fatigue 
	- Considering gait phase control for open source leg
- Bidirectional prosthesis effect on gait

14: specify extraneural 
22 - what's the reason for electrode proximity to residual end making the thresholds higher?

Bidirectional in upper?

Comments:
- Functional deficits can be attributed to lack of neural connection 
- Sensory motor integration 
- Null hypoth format : plantar sensation will be the same, same anatomical location / interface

**Improving outcomes after spinal cord injury: from academic research to clinical trials in industry**

Grad work: neural stim for exercise with paralysis 
- Rowing + biking
- Challenges: rapid fatigue + limited force output 
- Selective Neural Stim: nerve cuffs

Insurance?
- Thinking about which outcome measures are best for the pivotal study
- Reduction in BP meds / compensatory strats
Do they need stim for 8 hrs?  why not clsoed loop for certain postures

- But for some people 8 hrs a day, even in wheelchair is an orthostatic challenge
What's the mechanism?
- Theory: vasoconstriction
- Some slight abdominal contractions, not enough to account for BP rise

Reflexes: 1023
- Technology overview: cuffs, previous shown benefits
- Can it reduce fall risk: characterize spinal reflex pathways, evaluate EPS on stumble recovery strats
Characterize: H-reflex
- Stimulate peripheral nerve: non selective, produces efferent M-wave + 1a fibers 
	- sensory fibers activate muscle in smaller wave
- Modulated by proprioceptive inputs 
- Plantar sensation modulates modulation 
- Modulated over gait cycle: more excitable in gastrocnemius in late stance for more plantar flexion
EPS Reflex Exp
- Characterize EPS role on H-reflex excitability under different postures
- Hypoth: EPS will increase inhibition of H-reflex as in previous studies
Participants: cuff locations, plantar map
Postures mimic walking phases
- FP, match force amount 
- Train of EPS or not , single pulse stimulus to a different contact
Identifying H-reflex
- PCA
- H-reflex + M-wave recruitment curve looks typical : possible to elicit with electrical stim
Data
- EPS did not affect Hmax/Mmax but LL2 posture did affect it
- linear regression model 
- Not interferring with excitability 
Background EMG: motor neuron excitabilty, higher is more excitable
- EPS no effect on H-reflex gain despite diffs in background postures
Cutaneous modulation acts on proprioception fibers, remaining muscles may be compromised so EPS's effects may be blocked 
- EPS may also activate proprio fibers -> inhibitory + excitatory 
- Normally non selective whole tibial nerve stim for H-reflex 
- Contact stim activates subset of 1a fibers, smaller ratios

# Brain-computer interfaces for investigating how neural properties relate to adaptive learning

Event Date: October 24th 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM

**Speaker: Samantha R. Santacruz, Ph.D.**, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas Austin

**Abstract:** The brain is a complex system comprised of billions of neurons that work coherently together to control our behavior and general function. Large scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience, generating datasets manifesting rich and varied dynamics. To tackle the scale and complexity of the observed dynamics, numerous approaches based on a dynamical systems framework have been proposed. Here we use a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We also consider how neural properties, at the individual neuron and population level, explain adaptation during learning. To this end, we examine learning during a neurofeedback task with perturbations. We find that certain key properties are predictive of how critical a neuron or population is to learning and how well the animal can adapt their neural activity within the task framework. 

**About the Speaker:** Dr. Samantha R. Santacruz is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin, working on developing closed-loop neurotherapies and brain-machine interfaces to both treat neural pathologies and to better understand the neural mechanisms responsible. Dr. Santacruz received her B.A. degree with honors in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2006, her M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Rice University in 2010, and her Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at Rice University in 2014. She was awarded the Best Thesis Award for her doctoral work on engineering new methods of deep brain stimulation, supervised by Drs. Behnaam Aazhang and Caleb Kemere. She completed her postdoctoral work in Dr. Jose Carmena’s lab at UC Berkeley. In 2020 she was selected as one of 85 participants in the National Academy of Engineering US Frontiers of Engineering Symposium and in 2022 she received the NSF CAREER Award.

## Notes

Lots of brain structures involved in tasks 

Neural Signals: lots going on at differing scales
- Whole brain - EEG
Where to focus, what's relevant, integrate info at different scales

Microelectrode focus: invasive but good resolution signals 
- LPF -> Local field potential < 100 Hz
- HPF -> high freq spikes - single neuron AP

BCI - Hochberg
- neurotherapuetics + basic science 
	- Relate neural activity to behavior 

BCI Paradigm
- M1 and dorso premotor 
- Spikes over time 
- Decode activity into cursor movement 
Introduce perturbation

Hypoth: neural variability supports ability to adapt 

### Rotation Perturbation 
Biomimetic Decoder: mapping derived from animal doing a passive task
- Just watching cursor move 
- Great off the shelf performance

Perturbation of rotation - can grade difficulty 
- Arcing trajectory 
- Adapts over course of block 

What's happening neurally 
- Trial times / cursor distance increase right when perturbation is introduced
- Improves quickly 

Adaptation outcome measure: captures velocity via time and distance
- 15 and 90 degree rotations
- +/- doesn't matter
- Max adaptation

Neural Prosthesis Seminar: Robert Sainburg, Penn State University 
Dr. Sainburg's talk focused on the study of "handedness" with primarily stroke patients.  The motivation for this area of research came from the concept of lateralization in control structures.  Most people have speech and language centers of the cortex located in the left hemisphere and are left dominant.  Dr. Sainburg started looking into if there is a component of motor control that is also lateralized.  At a low level, the primary motor cortex maps symmetrically (and contralaterally) to the corresponding parts of the body it innervates.  However, in studies of fast arm movements toward targets in able-bodied participants the characteristics of the trajectories between the left and right arms differed.  Further studies elucidated that the dominant arm (right in all his studies) was more energy efficient.  Follow up studies, identified the right hand as performing better in tasks that were predictive in nature while the left hand was superior in uncertain environments.  Modeling studies produced similar results by showing right hand trajectories could be approximated with optimal control and left hand trajectories with impedance control.  In this way, there is a lateralization of control at a cortical level in motor control.  For stroke patients, this work led to the concept of treating the "good arm."  With a lesion in one hemisphere making the contralateral limb paretic, a stroke patient relies on their ipsilateral limb.  However, depending on which hemisphere was affected the intact limb will still struggle with some movements since each hand is optimized for different aspects of control.  Therefore, targeting the "good" arm with transcranial direct current stimulation or simply training regimes could improve quality of life for these patients by developing the arm most relied upon for a wider variety of motor tasks.

This talk discussed several different structures from class.  The concept of left hemisphere dominance used the example of language and referenced Broca's and Wernicke's area in all but name.  Low level motor control relating to the pre-central gyrus and the motor homunculus was also mentioned as a brief intro into low level motor control.  When explaining the patient characteristics in the studies Dr. Sainburg specifically called out the patients as suffering from MCA strokes leading to hemiparesis.  This section of the talk related to our unit on the Circle of Willis as the speaker referred to the middle cerebral artery as MCA..  It also directly called back to the many examples in class of localizing an injury's location based on the symptoms. 

Overall, I greatly enjoyed this talk and learned a lot about exploring a scientific question from various angles (experiments, modeling, clinical treatments).  Relating to neuroanatomy, I learned a lot about higher levels of cortical control and how to assess them experimentally.  In class, we have not discussed systems of control such as feed-forward control and internal models that are used to carry out movements.  We did identify the components of such systems like the cerebellum being central to producing coordinated movements and motor cortices being areas where muscle innervation originates.  While the field does have some overarching knowledge of the control systems that link these structures, this talk made it clear that they are far from completely understood.  For my lab's work in the lower limb, I wonder if there is as stark a difference in control of a dominant leg.  Especially since our participants are unilateral amputees, lateralization of motor control in the lower limb could make a big difference in their functional outcomes.

Pallidal response to proprioceptive modulation in Dystonia

Location: NORD 400 and hybrid (see link below)

Abstract - "Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder that affects around one million people worldwide, and current treatments aim to modify proprioception, a sense that can be disrupted in dystonia. While traditionally thought to be a disorder of the basal ganglia, recent studies suggest that the cerebellum may also be involved in dystonia development. This study aimed to examine the effect of high-frequency neck vibration on pallidal physiology in CD and how this information is integrated into the downstream motor circuit that includes the cerebellum. The results showed that neck vibration instantaneously altered the pallidal single neuron activity, increasing the regularity of firing. In isolated CD, the effects were prominent on neck-sensitive neurons, while in CD as part of generalized dystonia, the vibration also affected the firing regularity of non-neck-sensitive neurons. Neck vibration also modulated pallido-cerebellar and pallido-hippocampal connectivity in CD patients, with differences in modulation between the basal ganglia and cerebellum in the two types of dystonia suggesting compromised communication between these structures. The study sheds light on the mechanism of proprioceptive modulation in CD, suggests the effects of this therapy may be mediated through different neural circuits, and highlights the importance of burst neurons in dystonia and their potential role in developing new therapies for the disorder."

  

Goal: understand role of basal ganglia in proprioceptive info processing in movement disorders

- Parkinsons + Dystonia: peripheral responses appears normal, CNS issue

Dystonia: involuntary muscle contractions, tremor

![[Untitled 391.png]]

- Basal ganglia: receive input from cortex to modulate motor output
- Cerebellum may also play a role
- Interconnection betwixt basal ganglia + cerebellum → network disorder

Questions:

- What happens to activity of individual BG neurons
- cerebellar influence on changes in this network?

methods:

- vibration stimuli to provide input to muscle spindles
- measure globus pallidus internal GPi: outer nucleus of basal ganglia , approved DBS target
- Participants: 9 only in neck, 8 in whole body

Data analysis

- Tonic, burst, pause firing types: mostly burst, low amount of tonic

Single use response to vibration: 60 Hz

- Firing rate + frequency variation: reduced freq variation w/ vibration, change in pattern or more regular pattern
- Local Field Potentials: time series data → freq domain, ranges of freqs = bands
    
    - Different bands for communication between various areas of the brain
    - Is the cerebellum involved
    
    ![[Untitled 392.png]]
    
    ![[Untitled 393.png]]
    
- In Cervical D: alpha is higher with neck vibration, theta higher in general
    - Outputs of basal ganglia changing
    - How does output change with input : input = beta, alpha and theta on y
- Two different physiologies sending different messages to basal ganglia with similar output symptoms
- Neural subtypes had effect on increase/ decrease behavior : burst + pause

Summary

- proprioception plays a role in CD network
- Prop. modulates activity pattern of cells in GPi
- network changes in different areas depending on type of D
- Homogenous change in GPi in focal, heterogenous response in GD
- Burst neurons play an important role in manifestation of symptoms

  

Question

- Isolate skin afferents w/ lidocane patch to eliminate skin input? focus on muscle afferents
    - Should be possible
- Looking at other params to quantify firing pattern besides variance? is it worth it to look into?
- How is this engaging with internal model? Cortex using internal model, cerebellum forming it

# Seminar 4/20

Surgical design:

- Prosthetics have outpaced the amputation process in tech level
- Agonist antagonist connection severed
- AMI: regenerative peripheral nerves
- Plug severed nerves into muscles : micro to mili V signal
- Spindle fibers still functional, can transduce stretch

Clinical translation

- Surface and implanted emf
- Knee and ankle as well
- RPNI vs TMR: combo, often need more targets than tmr can provide

Effects

- Reduced pain and increased phantom percepts

  

Position differentiation

- 50 to 100
- Are signals clear enough , yes more differentiated
- Even at knee level, surface signals are differentiable
- Simple emg intens

Sensory feedback?

  

Central integration

- Visual becomes more important, motor image decreased
- Fmri study : 3a 3b 4a 4p
    - Left vs right: contralateral, change but not significant
- Sensory perception + motor execution
- 3a activition when doing plantar forsi flexion: comparable to non amputation
- Between 3 and 4: strengthen connections
- 3,6,9,12 months: no cortical atrophy, need to see more, stim threshold stable

ami don't display overreliance on visual

Proprioception affecting PNS and CNS

  

Robot to human limb

# 3/22 Sahaba Kukke

Have extra curriculars

Find a mentor who supports you, not just your product / output

Cultivate ability to observe and be introspective from others examples : learn from others

Finding out nature: can be expressed in different ways

- What excites me
- I can still be in science without being at the bench or having a lab of my own
- Can support science + have more fun in different jobs i.e. program director
- Everyone brings best ideas to R01

Can have lots of different roles and identifies: they strengthen each other

- Motherhood
- How can we do it all: not everything has to be done this year, right now
- Seeing people older that are still achieving in science is inspiring
- Not everyone has to take a longer time but it's okay if you do

Integrate all the parts of you into what you're doing

  

Self sufficiency, learn your own nature, mentorship, integrating own personalities

  

Learning by example

  

  

Balance challenging + supporting mentor mentee relationships

- Have conversations to establish the 4/5 year plan
- Honest evaluation of own work

  

Successful role models is the key for women in stem

- Advice for female trainees
- Internalized some things, assumed it was just me instead of the situation of being the only girl maybe
- Contending with it more now professionally: more obj, thinking about kids
- Improve quality of one on one interactions now

  

Career after a faculty pos, did you consider different areas

- Didn't want to go too far, all scientific
- Considered scientific writing

  

Something about faculty positive that wasn't what you expected? Why did you leave

- Loved teaching
- Didn't enjoy time sink, 5 classes a year: felt impossible to do both with a successful lab
- University depends on undergrad tuition, focus on that, research was secondary

Also being in uncomfortable situations can be good for you

- It can be easy to stay where you are
- Think about your future

  

Finding mentors

- Can be scary to ask but people do love to help

  

How to keep in touch with mentors moving forward in your career

- It's hard, have to make an effort
- If you're in the same field, attending at conferences , meet up there
- Occasionally email always welcome
- Can you just cold call after having fallen out of touch, yes it's okay!
- Email when got think of them, need smth, when there's a change, new job , thanks for support and all

  

Deciding on your position at NIH

- Proximity to home, nature of job, get an informational interview what's a day in the life, what kind of projects do you get
- Interview will give yot a feeling of people and nature of the work

  

No regrets, look forward; some things

Some time you just have to sit and synthesize

# 2/8 Lee Fischer

Sensation postulated to lead to phantom pain, issues walking etc, quality of life

Using spinal cord stim

- Perc trials, participants are awake and can note on a tablet where they feel things

  

Upper Arm

- All 4 had hand sensation regardless of time since + length of amputation
- Stability: concern of movement of spinal implants
    - How long does the body take to hold the implant: glial scar, 6 weeks
    - Not really large changes in thresholds for min charge
    - Removal: slide them right out
    - Not expecting more changes due to interface after 4 weeks
    - Much larger contacts, driving larger currents
    - Most of movement happens right after surgery to week 1: little movement in following weeks
        - Clinical migration 15%: moving too much to reprogram cm vs mm as we typically think
- Have not measured cortex / functional MRI yet
- Lots of subject to subject variability : have not found consistent ways to change modality of sensation, freq, stim pattern
    - Don’t have secret sauce yet, seems mostly driven by where electrodes end up
- Upper limb: needed configs of cathodes + anodes to get focal sensations, lower limb monopolar is sufficient
    - Had trouble getting through all stim parameters in 4 weeks, now do quick survey + focus on promising one
- Prosthetic control w/ sensory feedback
    - No subj was a prosthetic limb user
    - Open + close control via EMG: detect size + stiffness of obj, blinded and deafened
    - Performs above chance: 33% but soft obj often reported medium, not perfect

  

Lower Limb

![[Untitled 398.png]]

![[Untitled 399.png]]

  

- Diabetic amputations common in addition to trauma: can we evoke sensations in diabetic subjects, DPN - could do it with!
    - Is elicited sensation stronger in leg vs foot for diabetic subjs?
        - Threshold lower
    - Does phantom pain + telescoping change?
        - Clinically meaningful reductions in pain
        - Telescoping: not one has reported it, but hasn’t done careful measurement of end of limb
    - Subj 1 had some sensation on the intact limb: random switching between electrodes
        - sometimes not paying close attention to what’s going on
        - Can produce sensation in both limbs depending on medial placement of electrode
- Draw line where amputation is : after 2 weeks sensations move to missing limb
    - Keep pinging electrodes closest to end of residual limb
    - Could be plasticity, changing params, getting used to the sensation
- Neural plastic effects over minutes
    - Residual at first, over the morning sensations move to missing foot
    - 4 trials of 1 sec stim train at first; constant 10 min stim; repeat 4 trains:
        
        ![[Untitled 400.png]]
        
        - Consistent over several months
- Walking with sensorized prosthesis
    - Modulate sensation during walking due to insole
    - SOT improvement : Nanivadekar AC, et al medRXiv - bioarchive for clinical study, med archive
    - Reduced number of “falls”: takes step, puts arm out, rests in harness
    - Improvements in composite equil score: one had clinically relevant improvement
    - How does with stim compare to intact sensation: able bodied is mid to high 90s
    - Only in most challenging conditions you see an effect
    - Gait stability: functional gait assessment
        - Subj 3 saw clinically relevant improvement
        - Subj 2 performing well even with stim off
- More challenging tasks
    - Narrowing beam: 8 inches + narrowing beam, walk with arms crossed
    - Validated in amputees: clinically meaningful distance
    - Just modulated sense of pressure across all 5 toes, no lateral information !
        - Aware of foot on ground, trying harder, confident
        - Try sham condition with non useful sensation: residual limb not missing
            - Could try random timing of stimulation
        - Challenge of knowing when stim is on
    - Did not reduce reliance on visual feedback
    - Confidence survey: balance confidence index, saw clinically meaningful improvements
- Looking to see effects on falls
- Latency from pressure insole to change of stim param = 10 ms
    - Don’t know from insole delay
- Pain
    - Increase during period of no stim
        
        ![[Untitled 401.png]]
        

  

Higher density spinal cord electrodes

  

Q&A

- Phantom pain: more of periphery issue vs CNS
    - Is effect due to restored sensation or overwriting (gait theory approach, activate tactile afferents, reduce periphery input)
    - Neuroma pain manifested as residual or phantom limb pain, changes in firing DRG with no input, downstream changes
    - How much plasticity in somatosensory cortex
    - Sensory motor mismatch of input signals
    - Emotional components: depression
    - Many aspects contributing to pains: focusing on reducing sensory motor mismatch
    - Still seeing reduction over “last week” vs right now when stimulating
        - Longer duration effects present , changes in networks vs traditional gait theory that shuts down pain pathway
- DRG stim to prevent migration?

# 11/18 SFN Recap

Osseointegration

- Sheep - possibly a good bone match
- Insole approach
- Electrode “inside” bone + osseo
- Hard to get both parts working

Stani: neuroprosthesis for DPN

- Walk w/ and w/o surface stim: measure area of dorsal surface they can feel with Q-tip
- FGA functional gait analysis: gait metrics, cadence improved
    - set of clinical tests, how far out of range they walk, tasks
    - No 3D mocap
- Probably publishing soon
- HM: not very good metrics

Peripheral Nerve Regn

- electrical stim during surgery helps healing
- But afterwards doesn’t do much
- Rats are hardier than people may not transfer
- Trigeminal is reachable via surface stim
- 1 hr of stim during repair surgery

Participant Driven Stim Parameters

![[Untitled 412.png]]

- Cortical implant: Utah array , BCI
- What would it feel like to pet a cat: moving hand across something
- They had no context for the parameters they were changing
    - Amptitude, freq, drag?, shape
- Did not overlap with different people
- Had trouble discriminating similar things: toast vs towel
- Quick feedback with stim params is interesting
    - Could use for calibration
    - Vs a million thresholding trials
    - Use ASCU capabilities
    - We typically don’t have time to mess with all variables
    - We also have a 3 region approach, maybe approximate a step

Thermal Phantom Sensation

![[Untitled 413.png]]

- Thermostim on residual limb → phantom temperature feeling
- Areas that project to the phantom
- Different fiber type
- Assumed normal amputation surgery
- Had done work with TIMEs , assumed same participants but this isn’t using the electrodes
- Does temperature changes from wearing a prosthesis affect or override our sensation

H-Reflex

- Albany VA
- Model to correct for factors that affect size of H-reflex, give better biofeedback
- Could be for reducing or increasing size of reflex

Dual Task Inteference

![[Untitled 414.png]]

- Flat or stacked blocks
- Eye movement is interesting: ahead, ground, or objects
- Gait mat: velocity, cadence, step width, step length, double support
- Carrying a mug of coffee: gimbal effect in wrist, compensating for movements as you walk to keep coffee steady
    - Sensory integration of how body is moving
- Compare autism + ADHD : visual attention

  

HM VR

- no skull rn

# Dept Seminar

1. What length of the vagus nerve are they planning to image? And, is there a length limitation for their imaging modality? If so, is it possible to take images of 2 separate lengths along the vagus nerve and overlay their images to track longer lengths of the nerve? I am not familiar with the organization of the vagus nerve, but I think it would be interesting to understand how the fascicles are intertwined along the length of the nerve.
    1. Need to image human vagus nerve along it's length
    2. 5cm surgical window
    3. Positional sensitivity: 10-25 splits and merge
    4. Happens across all sizes, make female , left right
    5. Segmentation of nerves
    6. Detailed 3D models : realistic fiber paths lead to lower activation thresholds
        1. Directionally consistent still
        2. Activition can happen at various locations around cuff
    7. Higher resolution imaging, more modalities
    8. Expanded scope
    9. Study for generalized pathing
    10. New imaging
        1. 3D Muse tibial nerve
    
2. Has this approach for imaging the vagus nerve has been used on other peripheral nerves (e.g. the sciatic nerve) before? And if not can these techniques be used for the sciatic nerve (or other peripheral nerves)? Dr. Gustafson and Dr. Triolo published a paper a few years ago tracking the human distal sciatic nerve. And, it would be interesting to know if this new approach can be used to visualize the sciatic nerve in more detail. [https://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/2012/492/gustafson492.html](https://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/2012/492/gustafson492.html)
    1. Mentioned Dr Gustafsons work examining sciatic
    2. Looking at spinal cord
    3. Doral root ganglion
    4. Tibial yea

  

# 11-16 MSK Seminar

Dr. William Ledoux: Anatomical and Functional Limb Loss Prevention at CLiMB

  

Intro: Center for Limb Loss + MoBility

- Research + Rehab center

Motivation

- Large numbers affected by limb loss, veterans more likely to be affected by diabetes
- Functional limb loss prevention: ankle arthritis, deformed feet
- Severe flat feet , great toe arthritis
- Treatments:
    - Ankle arthrisis: fusion or replacement of joint
    - Arch
    - Hallux rigidus: fusion, remove part of joint, replacement

Diabetes: population

- Does high plantar pressure lead to higher change to develop ulcer there?
    - In shoe plantar pressure, 7 locations
    - Found some non ulcer patients had higher baseline plantar pressure (heel + halix), in metatarsal heads then it was related to baseline plantar pressure
- How 3d foot shape is associated with plantar pressure

Diabetes: cadaveric

- Biochemical + histologal chars leading to changes in plantar soft tissue stiffness
- Macro + micro: mech properties, histology
- Biochemical: collagon
- Histological: how much fat, thicker in diabetic
- Mech properties
    - Stiffer tissue was stiffer at higher freeq
        - differences in location (modulus) + diabetic status
        - Diabetic tissue was always stiffer at any freq and location
    - Shear:
    - Needed to actually measure collagen crosslinking to link biochem and mech properties

Diabetes: patient-specific

- Altered foot shape + aberrant plantar soft tissue properties leading to internal stress + increased risk of ulceration?
- Internal pressure is much greater in plantar fat than skin, locaiton also different
- Computational models: detailed models of joints, skins
- Estimate material properties for human subjects: HyPSTR, for use in MRI scanner
    - Validation with ultrasound
    - lots of motion at first, then very little
    - plot of load applied vs deformation of heel pad: diabetic subjects needed higher forces for same deformation, 3x stiffer
- Tibial kinematics from lab, move model through space + let model interact with ground
    - Can see the bones move as expected

Robotic Gait simulation

- Neil Sharkey : robotic walking simulator with cadaver
- Early attempts not accurate to GRF of actual gait
- Mikrolar company - rotopod
- Can answer questions about different pathologies + interventions
- Accurate GRF

Biplane Fluroscopy

- one of 40 gorups with this
- Imaging underneath through the floor

  

Ideas on temperature based ulcer detection?

- Combine with HyPSTR? not yet, collecting data took a while

  

# 11/16 HC Metro Presentation

Lower limb amputees : risk of fall, rehab, re-amputation

No prosthesis interfaces with nervous system

How to re-establish nervous connection: sensory + motor

- Sensory: high density nerve cuff electrode
- Motor: IM electrodes

  

Cuff electrodes

- Cuffs undergo a lot of stresses, active individuals
- SNP: pressure sensation to prosthesis

  

Results

- Improvement in gait symmetry:
    
    ![[Untitled 420.png]]
    
- Enhanced forward propulsion on prosthetic side
- Will be relating it to metabolic cost eventually
- Perception of walking speed:
    - Difficult since it’s more associated with proprioception
    - Speed under intact always constant, random changes in prosthetic side
    - Do they perceive one side differently
- What biomechanical changes contribute to this
    - COM of velocity symmetry: when vertical is zero prosthetic COM vel is less than intact side
    - Reduced when SNP active
    - _Overall body movement reduced, prosthetic side moved less_
    - Q: how does this affect real world scenario?
        - Theoretically slipping
        - No specific real world scenario
        - Mismatch between actual and perceived movement
- Added motor adaptation task
    - Assessing perceptional recalibration of walking speed
    - Split belt, MAT, split belt
    - Plantar sensation plays a role in motor adaptation
    - Symmetry judging afterwards: perception results affected by motor adaptation
    - Somatosensory cortex could be involved

  

Plantar sensation + foot placement: functional

- Searching strategy becomes similar for intact limb with sensation vs hell first

  

Balancing: Sensory organization test

- Walls move, platform, visual
- Sensory input plays a role when you perturb intact or put incongruency betwixt vision + vestibular

  

Reflex responses

- Sensation from lower limb controls H-reflex
- Mimic postures, loading amounts

  

Effects on daily living: 290 of homegoing

- Dressings: can be changed daily, waterproof can shower with it
- Not vascular: challenge to have percutaneous leads distally
    - Subjects give regular updates
    - Has been some skin irrtation

Stair navigation effects

- Pre active: lead with prosthesis , using intact to maintain stability
- Self reported stumbles: less and less while active, begins to return afterwards

Improved app interface

- Calibration, stim parameters, battery monitoring

  

Motor: identifying EMG patterns + extracting features

- Goal of generating control law to feed into powered prosthesis: Open source Uof Michigan, also working with Ottobock and Ossur
- Portable controller for bidirectional neuroprosthesis
    
    ![[Untitled 421.png]]
    
- Integrated portable controller for recording, save, stream EMG + deliver electrical sim

  

Diabetic Amputees

- Looking at limb health

  

Can restore sensation, improve gait symmetry, speed perception, locomotor adaptation

long term use increases confidence in prosthesis + lowers stumble freq.

  

Questions

- 40 years of amputation, motivations for joining study? wanted to help people down the road, before knowing the effects
- Manipulate phantom sensation ? phantom limb grew to length of intact limb
    - Functional implications with obstacle negotiation, overshooting
    - Home going: changes in description of phantom limb, shape formation
    - Modulating intensity of stim can affect perception: intense stim can cause bothersome phantom feeling
    - Clinical implications : modulate detelescoping of limbs + understand what’s happening the brain
        - HC: due not to lack of input but incorrect input , we correct it
- Translation: obstacles, lower-limb has a chance to make a difference; embedded industry, clinicians don’t understand about neural interface
    - Other surgical approaches: osseointegration , benefits, gaining traction (helping our intervention )
    - Our systems will be delivered at a later stage probably, different surgical team?
    - What’s the translational roadmap
- Falls do happen 2x as often
    - Stability is still decent with transtibial
    - will be interesting to see how it changes with transfemoral
    - Fear of fall is also important
- Other surgical stuff TMR, AAMI
    - Not all are successful

# Mark Grabiner

Methods to reduce falls in older adults

- Few return to original mobility, requires long term care + $
- Absolute number of older adults + falls is increasing

Experiments with new trip protocol to induce trips and falls

- Started w/ young people, no one fell
- Lots of trunk flexion, hypothesized the step length would be reduced
- Forward and downward rotation of body

Balance measures didn’t relate to each other OR ability to avoid falls

Looked to muscle strength

  

Trip related stepping response (not outcome of fall or recovery)

- Two solutions to a trip
- Lowering
    - Foot in contact with obstacle is lowered to floor and supports body weight
- Elevating
    - Leg of foot that’s tripped takes first step over obstacle
    - 70 ms faster, longer recovery step length
- Two causes of fall: load in safety harness = 50% of body weight
    - During step fall: threshold within 80ms of recovery foot contacting floor
    - After step fall: @ least 470 ms after recovery step completion

Muscle strength and power vars: 18

- Lowering strat + during step fall = stronger

![[Untitled 431.png]]

- Muscle strength + power were not risk factors

  

Motion of trunk + effect on recovery step length come back

- Trunk angular velocity in opposite directions

![[Untitled 432.png]]

![[Untitled 433.png]]

- Those who recovered had longer recovery step length and smaller trunk flexion length

  

Treadmill protocol: 5 trials, same perturbation, enough to cause fall but possible to recover

- Most were able to recover after 1st trial fall, nervous system tuning coordination : less than 2 mins

![[Untitled 434.png]]

- Orange: 42 people who recovered in first
- Trial 1 fall: 23 people who fell in first trial
- Trial 2: successful recovery of 23 people
- People adjust to match within one trial!

  

Improve motor skills with deliberate practice

Developing a treadmill with precision control

Short term trip specific training protocol would increase ability to avoid falls (2005, 16 years after elevator talk)

- Algorithm that increase or decrease perturbations based on performance
- 4 sessions / week for 4 weeks

![[Untitled 435.png]]

  

But did this motor skill improvement help with trips, yes!

![[Untitled 436.png]]

Works under controlled lab conditions!

- Difference not due to differences in clumsiness

Would it work in the community? Yep!

- 4 sessions over 2 weeks

![[Untitled 437.png]]

- 23 % decrease, 24%: high degree of certainty, true effect is close to estimated
- Tai Chi: certainty is very low

  

Trip specific vs all cause falls, 4 sessions over 2 weeks! : effective and efficient

  

Amputated tripping

- Expected lowering or elevating strategy
- Prosthetic tripped = lowering stat: support on prosthetic
- Sometimes prosthesis caused fall: did not adjust knee stiffness
- Non prosthetic tripped: both except for one, hopped over obstacle

  

Questions

- Role of sensation?
    - Integration of somatosensory changes esp with amputees
    - Believes it is important, missing that from treadmill test
    - No visual field motion, static start: but it still works!
- What sensory modality would you restore to prevent falls?
    - Depends on which foot is tripped and which strat is used
    - Plantar surface is important during lowering phase or propulsion phase
    - Knee or hip action is important: sensing of that movement, vestibular, joints in limb, visual
- Efficacy of just core / trunk strengthening exercises?
    - Never tested core strength, just associated importance with it
    - Ability to control strength is the important motor skill
- Retention of training?
    - Older adults: 1 yr prospective study
    - Amputees DoD: 6 months
    - More practice may be necessary: **is it enough to show videos of people falling?** See what is necessary
        - _informed consent can influence model_: permission to deceive
        - Those that didn’t know what was going to happen had worse outcomes

  

  

# NeuroTech Talk - Non-invasive peripheral nerve interfaces

## Alejandro Covalin

Intro: Spark biomedical, brining an idea to market adoption

Challenges: expectations, assumptions, execution

- No money, need good people, plan always changing

The IDEA

- Target an unmet need w/ a cost effective, marketable, manufacturable idea

Obtain DATA: fxn prototypes

Protect the IDEA: patent

Value of Idea: academic institutions typically ask 2-5%

![[Untitled 438.png]]

  

Idea —> Market Adoption

- Pre Market
    - Assemble team: get right people on board
    - Right amount of $: enough runway to fix mistakes
    - Clinical partner
    - Regulatory authorities: not always correct, may tend toward path of least resistance (case overload)
- post market
    - Sup chain
    - THE early adopters
    - growing sales + marketing: doctors aren’t risk takers
    - reimbursement: will this save them money
- Just getting device to market will not make it successful, necessary but not sufficient

Opiod example

- Market: is there room for a new service

Becoming dependent: body stops producing natural opioids , withdrawal puts you in a survival state

- They don’t want to feel bad
- Intervene in stage of withdrawal symptoms

  

Sparrow Wearable neurstimulation: patch around ear, patient controller module, app

- “irrational consumers” need product to look good!
- Baby version is smaller

  

Study: COWS score reduction, 50% in the first hour

- Delayed stimulation as placebo!
- Clinical + statistical reduction in depression / PTSD
- Reduced time needed for babies to be in special care units + reduce time on morphine

Cala Health, Founder’s Journey, Needs Driven Innovation

  

Cala Trio, patient centered care

Leadership team: importance of team culture

- Look across industry segments

Founder’s story

- Finding out what you don’t like

Biodesign Innovation process: focus on the need + understanding end user

![[Untitled 440.png]]

Think about how you split your time and how you would like to split your time

## Joaquin Azpilicueta

Xana:

Vagus Nerve: rest + digest, heart rate regulation

3odus: earbud piece w/ electrodes + app

Old paradigm: “medicine is benevolent and commerce is dirty”

Proposing value based health care approach: deliver value

- Currently we pay more for less

![[Untitled 441.png]]

Difficult for innovation to penetrate + lots of adoption barriers

![[Untitled 442.png]]

  

Early on startups burn money in the first 1-5 years, after certification race to success starts

![[Untitled 443.png]]

14 adoption barriers: crossing the chasm

- Early adopters to mainstream

![[Untitled 444.png]]

Med Tech innovaiton

- Where to commercialize? countries, regions
- Who/how to engage partners: best match with distributions, transparency in sales process
    - Distributors are investors
- Manage w/ excellence: distributors are partners, investors, customers , not second class citizens

How do you find early adopters?

- younger professional, willing to take risks, less executive power + influence
- Leader + early adopter is amazing but rare
- Networkinggg
- Nurture relationships
- Searching + nurturing

Switzerland environment vs other countries

- Hard to find investment, medtech cycles are too long
- Can be hard to find partners
- Switzeralnd has highest density of medtech investment, UK is higher absolutely
- Smart investors

  

## Panel

Long term effects of non-invasive simulation? Habituation, side effects?

- Small cutaneous irritations mitigatable by charge balancing
- Not aware of any unwanted long term side effects
- Need to know where to apply current like any other stim tech, be aware of current / field reach
- Looking at implantable stimulators: side effects tend to come from infection risk, surgical acute effects and not the stimulator itself
- Peripheral nerves are made to take in signals: fundamentally targeted
- Main risks are skin irritation
- Scaring that reduces conductivity long term: coatings + material choice can mitigate for implantaed
- Percutaneous virtually impossible to do harms
- Stimulating fxns of brain could do damage, must be careful
    - Vagus nerve stim can stop arrythmia therefore could also cause it

Neuroethics of device? Recording data?

- Ethics changes w/ the times
- AC: neurostim will go into enhancement of abilities, performance
    - Some ethical questions: is it correct to boost ability
    - Not harming anyone, just benefiting someone
    - **does a rising tide lift all ships**
- JA: sports performance, doping
    
    - purpose is not enhance abilities but put them in best position to increase performance
    - Ex: stayed up late for exam, can’t sleep
    - no ore unethical than doing yogo or meditation
    - Is something that has to be considered with competitive sports
    - Treating a medical condition is totally different
    
      
    

Trio requires a prescription

So does Spark biomedical

  

Few examples where things are reimbursed but not prescribed

- Think about pricing model early on
- Challenge is getting on market at scale

  

Handling an internship you don’t like?

- consider commitment

  

How to find your interest area in neuro?

- Is there room for growth + development
- People looking for skill sets but also for the person
- Want a person that fits, someone with drive

  

Master or PhD

- Depends on what part of business they want to be
    - Science part, tech dev = PhD, rigor + training from that
