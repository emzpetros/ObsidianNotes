Areas:  
Phantom Pain  
mimic terrain and ambulatory modes  
controller via simulation  
perception: improve elicited sensation  
functional: balance etc

Dr Triolo Feedback:

- hypotheses driven ; testable
- Model the dynamics of a robotic prosthesis, weight, friction, damping

## Ideas

- [ ] Training in VR w/ FES: help train users to use a sensory neuroprosthesis
- [ ] Modulating virtual elements to influence outcomes: R18 - change size of arm to adjust pain, optic flow to encourage gait and posture, investigate how amputees process + adjust to visual input
- [ ] Training in VR vs CAREN system: does it produce greater or comparable improvements in functional outcomes
- [ ] Does VR offer more improvements than passive viewing or is it just the game / engagement that makes the difference? - Answer VR better in other cases, apply it with newer tech + amputees specifically
- [ ] Dual Task: someone did a study w/ weight + dual task for stim
- [ ] virtual balance board training ; affect of visual vs somatosensory feedback
- [ ] BioPatRec for lower limb application w/ sensory feedback
- [ ] mismatched touch on heel; mismatch entire scenario not just sensation
- [ ] Crowd walking / cognitive tasks
- [ ] Modeling prosthesis behaviro: motors, mechanical properties in motor; level of contorl

## Paper

- [ ] Emotionally evocative tasks in VR, desktop-HMD-6 wall
- [ ] NB: Graphs can be more useful than tables to visually see differences
- [ ] Hunter Hoffman: VR + Pain
- [ ] A lot of studies focus on myoelectric control of virtual limb
- [ ] What assessments are there for lower limb function? (myoelectric control); treadmill tests - speed
- [ ] NB: graphs should have comparable y-axis if possible
- [ ] More natural tracking
- [ ] Motor imagery of the foot
- [ ] Imagine an intact foot: close eyes and imagine
- [ ] Theresholding: see both feet, turn in stim
- [ ] Localizing perception
- [ ] Le04 percepts stay on residual nerves: blindly blast to overall fibers
- [ ] Drawing
- [ ] Risks of VR acknowledged ,but not in study plan
- [ ] Lower leg angle control
- [ ] Delsys emg days use accelerator met
- [ ] Suzhou Evan Hamid and Eileen : feeding emg into
- [ ] Binary up and down movement
- [ ] After the 20th and after Thanksgiving sit together
