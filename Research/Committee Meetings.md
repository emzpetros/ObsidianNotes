Foot and Ankle Sensory Neuropathy, Proprioception, and Postural Stability
- Icing had an effect vs anesthesia: not taking out proprioception + joint movements
- - More variability but more stable gait!

Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates the brain's response to foot stimuli under dual-task condition: A fMRI study in elderly adults
- Foot stimuli alone caused cortical activation that was lessened under cognitive task -> less resources available to devote to processing foot sensation
	- ***Maybe more done in automatic circuits!***
- No information provided about the cognitive performance on task!!
	- Was the accuracy or response time any different between ST and DT?  With the addition of tDCS?
	- Would a motor task that relies more upon plantar sensation be more affected

Cognitive Architecture and Instructional Design
- Novice vs experts - differentiator is long-term memory reserves not working memory 
- Working memory = limit on # of items but NOT their complexity 
- Schemas can be very complex + consist of lower level ones 



DT generally with impaired populations esp brain imaging
Not examining plantar input

When examining plantar and cortical -> postural 
- One eeg study "Neural Correlates of Dual-Task Walking: Effects of Cognitive versus Motor Interference in Young Adults"

Understanding and Measuring the Cognitive Load of Amputees for Rehabilitation and Prosthesis Development
- Neural fatigue: Amputees must therefore deliberately control their movement rather than rely on natural automatic responses to external stimuli.
- "In an individual without an amputation, the brain receives bottom-up sensory information and compares it with internal body representation—the body’s position or status within its environment—and uses that to predict outcomes while updating the body’s representation accordingly.8 This creates a synergy between bottom-up inputs and top-down outcomes that establishes a feeling of certainty within the environment."
- ***remove visual input*** 
- More suitable than even able bodied to measure cognitive loading

Benefit of SNP to cognitive effects, just as important as functional - impacts the functional as well 

Effects of changes in plantar sensory feedback on human gait characteristics: a systematic review
- Mix of healthy + pathological participants 
- ISSUE: some studies didn't have a detectable sensation change 
- Less effect of textured insole with healthy than impaired
	- Expected, not playing a huge role for unimpaired populations *until* under cognitive load perhaps??

Parkinson's
- Posture second gait strategy 
- what about LLA??

Upright percetion
- Multiple sensory integrations
- mostly done with centrally impaired populations
- Related to postrual control studies 
- Is it a reduced ability to respond to perturbations or a disturbed sense of upright ness
	- Has the internal model changed??

In accordance with the multimodal sensory contributions to perception of upright, alterations in the neck, trunk, and interoceptive inputs have modulating effects on perceptual upright responses (30, 61, 67–75). For example, vibration of the neck muscles can shift SVV errors in the opposite direction of the head tilt and increase the E-effect (73, 76, 77). Thus, the brain must be able to determine upright orientation either directly, by accessing the estimate of head-in-space orientation through the sensory inputs encoding head position (e.g., otolith signals), or indirectly, through the sensory inputs encoding neck and trunk positions (54).

Does somatosensory feedback from the plantar foot sole contribute to verticality perception? - Nedelkou et al. (2021).
- Hard vs firm surface made a difference in absence of vision 
- Using head control to move the line negated difference in surface + improved performance with soft
	- Input of proprioception + muscle spindles 
- Normal values +- 2%

Plantar cutaneous afferents influence the perception of Subjective Visual Vertical in quiet stance- Foisy et al. (2018).
- Foam pads or bilateral/ unilateral arch supports to induce lean
- Found those with normal cutaneous use

Qualitative perception as well 

Contralateral effects: cortex is not primed for sensory input
