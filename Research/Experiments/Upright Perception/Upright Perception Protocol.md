Awaiting IRB approval to perform standing version of the experiment 
# Purpose
Investigate electrically elicited plantar sensation and perception of verticality 

Hypothesis: Upright perception will modulate the perception of verticality 
# Materials
Dark room
OLED monitor
Standing chin rest
Bite bar or other method to consistently tilt head
Portable Force plates
Walker or another item the participant can use to stabilize themselves while standing 

Location: Ocular Motility Dark Room
# Methods
4 participants with lower limb loss implanted with high density cuff electrodes

LL01: difficulty standing for long periods of time, will implement task with other particiapnts first  
LL04: TBI
## Stimulation Parameters
Stimulation will be cathodic first, biphasic, charge balanced square waves in two flavors: unvaried and varied.  In both cases, we will elicit sensation in two locations/contacts and cycle between them during active stimulation trials.
- Unvaried pulse train: constant PA and PW, switch between locations every 5 seconds
- Varied pulse train: ramping PW values with constant PA, switch between locations every 5 seconds and ramp the intensity up (2.5s) and down (2.5s)
	- Ex: PA = 1.0 mA, PW = 80-220 
## Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV)
A 2AFC implementation of the SVV task will be used as detailed in [Winnick et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00892)
## Outcome Measures
Psychometric curves will be calculated from each 100 trial run of the SVV experiment.
Characteristics of the curves will be quantified to determine accuracy and precision of the upright perception during that condition

12 total conditions 
- For each condition combination collect one session of SVV (100 trials)
- All conditions will be completed in the *same day*
- Practice trials for familiarization to the standing and head tilt conditions  

## Experiment Flow: no more than 2 standing trials in a row, including practice runs (10 mins)

Additional 30 mins for thresholding to determine stimulation parameters for the day

TOTAL: 110 mins

# Outstanding Questions 
- [ ] Stimulation parameters for the varied stimulation condition
- [x] Are we doing standing with foam?  Placed under just the intact foot?
- [ ] Are we doing head tilts at this time as well
- [x] Location of experiments: which rooms can be made dark rooms and have a force plate available 
- [ ] Do we need multiple SVV's for the head tilt conditions, if so how many
- [ ] One participant had a hard time seeing the line clearly with his glasses, is there a way to address this or is it just part of viewing an OLED screen with poorer vision?
