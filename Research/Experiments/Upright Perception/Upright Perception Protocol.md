# Purpose
Investigate electrically elicited plantar sensation and perception of verticality 

Hypothesis: Upright perception will modulate the perception of verticality 
# Materials
Dark room
OLED monitor
Standing chin rest
Bite bar or other method to consistently tilt head
Force plates
Walker or another item the participant can use to stabilize themselves while standing 

Location:
- ReLLiNC Lab: use the Bertec Computerized Dynamic Posturography machine?
- MSL: can it be made into a dark room?
# Methods
4 participants with lower limb loss implanted with high density cuff electrodes

|Participant​|Age​ (years)​|Time since Amputation (years)​|Affected Side​|Implant Surgery Date|
|LL01​|67​|48​|Left​|May 2016​|
|LL02​|54​|9​|Right​|December 2016​|
|LL03​|66​|23​|Right​|May 2018​|

LL01: difficulty completing the SVV due to his glasses causing the red line to blur 
LL04: TBI
## Stimulation Parameters
Stimulation will be cathodic first, biphasic, charge balanced square waves in two flavors:
- Unvaried pulse train: PW and PA determined by thresholding with participant feedback to match sensation from intact foot  
- Varied pulse train:  ??

In both cases, we will elicit sensation in two locations and cycle between them during active stimulation trials.
## Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV)
A 2AFC implementation of the SVV task will be used as detailed in [Winnick et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00892)
## Outcome Measures
Psychometric curves will be calculated from a 100 trial run of the SVV experiment.
Characteristics of the curves will be quantified to determine accuracy and precision of the upright perception during that condition  

# Experiment Design 
18 total conditions 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Condition​|Options​|
|Posture​|Sitting (feet raised), standing |
|Stimulation|None, Unvaried, Varied|   
|Head Tilt| None, Left (20&deg), Right (20&deg)|

For each condition combination collect one session of SVV (100 trials)
All conditions will be completed in the *same day*

Timing
- Thresholding for Stimulation Parameters: 30 mins
- SVV: 5 mins / SVV x 18 = 90 mins
- Breaks: 15-20 mins
2.5 hrs total

# Outstanding Questions 
- [ ] Stimulation parameters for the varied stimulation condition
- [ ] Are we doing standing with foam?  Placed under just the intact foot?
- [ ] Are we doing head tilts at this time as well
- [ ] Location of experiments: which rooms can be made dark rooms and have a force plate available 
- [ ] Do we need multiple SVV's for the head tilt conditions, if so how many
- [ ] One participant had a hard time seeing the line clearly with his glasses, is there a way to address this or is it just part of viewing an OLED screen with poorer vision?
