- [x] Redo early late plots
    - [x] put blue and orange bars together
    - [x] Add baseline
- [ ] ANOVA across sessions
    - [ ] Pull data together
- [x] inital and final, cut middle
    - [x] across trial
    - [x] across trial and within task
    - [x] within task
- [ ] Do variance analysis
- [x] Fix duplicated baseline gait plot variables
- [ ] Look for variance from baseline to non baseline
    - Could be evidence of a different type of integration of sensation form integration A to B
- [ ] Look at early late effect of variation
- [ ] 11-19 variation seems to increase, check temporal analysis
- [ ] Look at raw data, butterfly plots
- [x] Temporal, statistical test, baseline data
    - [x] Rewrite gait metric functions to just label to raw data based on time cutoffs but NOT aggregate it till later
- [ ] Look at daekyos manuscript on teams
- [x] LE01 + 2 gait parameter data

  

Process

- [ ] LE02
- [ ] Le04

  

Look at variance in speed

Re evaluate correction algorithm for misclicks, may have to do it manually or count mislicks automatically
