- balance tray
- 
All tend to use instrumented walkways

- Some differences found even with healthy older adults
- Good citations for using dual task results to predict falls


# AS 11/13 DT

Residual sensation: characterization
- Characterization 
- Focus on it's intensity as it wears down
- Focus somewhere else 

Scheduled amount of time to check in 

Perturbations on Egg
- Postural stability + DT 

Stairs + DT
- LE02 maybe performing poorly while talking 
- Does sensation improve it
