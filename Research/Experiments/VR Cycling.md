Need to do VR and non-VR on same day

Alternate trials + average them 
- Shorter trials, consistent rest breaks 

Cadence same power higher: harder gear with VR trial

Fews difs in BP and HR

Rowing:
- Sig dif in distance + power (how much pulling on handle + spinning the flywheel)
- Time limited, distance may not change much 

Easier to get consistent rowing
- Can get stuck in places with the cycling
- Rowing is arms too 

Pulse ox fixed now
- but it has a lot of variability 
Single session fatigue
- Plataeus to steady state about half way through trial
- Have to alternate conditions 

Extract separately 

Fatigue will happen
- Randomizing vs fatigue
- Non-VR first, if sig difference then it is bc of fatigue
	- Benefit to non-intervention 

Tissue oxy: could it be because headset was on
- Drop happens in 1st minute 
- Bigger drop in VR, with more power produced 
- Power / oxygen consumed ? Efficiency measure 

Doubled his power, what happens in able bodied

Fast shortening, fast change in pressure in tissue 
- Uncontrolled contractions at beginning

Power spikes with drop in oxygenation 
- LEvels out at steady state like cadence 

Have to normalize to something - work output 

What do we want to see?  
- Need stress on muscle for adpataion
- Prolong exercise to get more power

What's causing higher peak power
- Doesn't seem to be greater blood flow or oxygenation 

A little volitional control 

Dynamic range of blood oxygenation 

Exercsive pressor reflex: which metric relates to that 

Central command ? is it more engagement 
- Compare goose + non goose mode

Higher BP in VR vs non-VR

Rowing exercise pressure response 
- HR and BP
Before + after bloodflow US

NIRs related to a ref value: 
- non invasive
- day to day variability 
Muscle sympathetic activity - not approved
- Microelectrical needle
