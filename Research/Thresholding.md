# **LE06 Thresholding Day 3 Plan**

**Setup**

Interview

- Make sure camera is set up

Thresholding

- Turn on computers right to left, password = rellinchc
- Speedgoat: blank with log
- Turn on UECU
- Documents > matlab > rellinc-experiments > apps > stim_threshold_app
    - Open stim_threshold_main.mlapp, run
- Please select subj: LE06, confirm
- Want on speedgoat: Connecting to UECU on waiting for start comment
    - If not > UECU off, speedgoat off, speedgoat on, UECU on
- Save as: Documents > Matlab > Data collected from exp > LE06 > File w/ data > proximal/sciatic > 20230111_LE06_Threshold_PS/DS > Save
- Check 3 windows: main app, summary, drawings on tablet
- One round of stim w/ oscilloscope w/ 2 channels
- Maddy’s connector
    - Once UECU charged, use connector 5-10s
    - Touch pins to skin before connecting
    - Warn before connecting, may feel jolt
- If crash, disconnect UECU from subj before restarting

**Task Order**

1. Short interview on phantom limb
2. Complete channels up to 2.6
3. Go up to pulse amplitude of 4.6 mA on all channels (unless sensation is accomplished earlier)
    1. PS first, then DS
4. Switch out the UECU and change to ground patch and cable with separate ground

**General Procedure**

1. Default settings: PW = 100, IPI = 50, Stim Time = 5s, Delay = 0s
2. Follow patterns below , then depending on intensity go down in PA, down in PW, or up in PA to verify/investigate sensation
    
    until there is sensation on a channel
    
    1. Notes: mouse is unavailable while he’s drawing, make sure he dictates while drawing
3. Only do 3 tests in a row per channel
4. Do not do consecutive channels right after each other
5. Chat some, and see if he needs breaks at times, water, to stretch/walk etc
6. No leading questions on sensation or reactions/comments that could cause bias
7. Keep video clips at around 20 min or less

**PS Low Values**

Channels 3, 11, 13

PA values: 1.6, 2, 2.6

**PS High Values**

All channels EXCEPT 6, 7, 9

- *Verify QD is under 70 before testing, drop PW if not**
