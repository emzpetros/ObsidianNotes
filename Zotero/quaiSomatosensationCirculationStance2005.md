> Objective: To establish the relationship between poor lower limb somatosensory and circulatory status with standing balance, falls history, age and mobility level in dysvascular transtibial amputees (TTAs). Design: Within-subjects evaluation of somatosensation, circulation and stance balance measures in dysvascular transtibial amputees. Setting: Physiotherapy department of a tertiary metropolitan hospital in Australia. Participants: Twenty-two community-dwelling unilateral dysvascular transtibial amputee volunteers, aged between 54 and 86 recruited from a metropolitan hospital outpatient amputee clinic. Main outcome measures: Lower limb vibration sense, light touch sensation and circulatory status were related to centre of pressure excursion during quiet stance, dynamic balance measures of forward and lateral reach distance, and demographic information such as falls history and mobility level.
Results: Overall, poor somatosensory status was associated with poor stance balance. There was an association between poor vibration and circulation and increased centre of pressure excursion in quiet stance and reduced reach distance, whereas poor light touch was linked with even weight-bearing in quiet stance. Poor vibration sense was associated with a history of frequent falls.
Conclusions: Compromised lower limb somatosensation and circulation was linked with poor balance and a history of frequent falls in the elderly dysvascular amputee population.

> However, internal representations within the central nervous system are altered after an amputation, greatly impacting on postural control.'

> The stump is thought to assume motor and sensory functions,2 but this might be limited, considering that often both traumatic and dysvascular amputees find it difficult to stand on their prosthetic leg with their eyes closed.3 This suggests that the stump cannot fully compensate for the foot as a proprioceptive organ, even in amputees with a healthy somatosensory system as represented by the young traumatic amputee group.

> It follows that for comprehensive central reorganization to occur, adequate peripheral somatosensation is crucial.

> The first aim of this study was therefore to investigate if there was a relationship between somatosensory (vibration and light touch) and circulatory status of the lower limbs and standing balance ability in elderly dysvascular unilateral amputees. A second aim was to determine if there was a relationship between somatosensory and circulatory status with demographics such as falls history, age and mobility level in elderly dysvascular amputees.

> A fall was defined to be any incident where subjects found themselves inadvertently on the floor, ground or other lower surface, regardless of whether they suffered an injury.'6 Clinical assessment of somatosensation and circulation included measures of vibration sense, light touch sensation and circulatory status of both limbs.

> Vibration sense, a measure of superficial and deep pressure sensation,17 was assessed using a tuning fork vibrating at 128 Hz.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Light touch sensation was tested using a number - 14 aesthesiometer (Senselab, Sweden).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Overall, poor lower limb vibration, light touch and circulation was associated with poorer static and dynamic balance. However, there was no one consistent variable responsible for stance balance ability, reinforcing the multifaceted physiological contribution to normal balance.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Poor vibration sense strongly predicted a history of frequent falls.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Due to an overall decrease in superficial and deep pressure sensation as indicated by low vibration sense score and the loss of the ankle as an important proprioceptive organ, this finding could reflect attempts to increase sensory input from their stump and knee on the amputated side.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Poor lower limb vibration sense was predictive of frequent falls, increased sway in stance, and reduced reach to the amputated side. * Reduced light touch ability predicted even weight-bearing. * Faint pulses predicted increased sidewards sway and reduced forward reach. * Vibration, light touch and pulses should be tested in elderly dysvascular amputees.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Although in general poor somatosensory and circulatory status was related to poor balance ability, no one element related to all functional measures.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Poor vibration sense was related to increased anterior-posterior centre of pressure excursion in quiet stance, a reduced lateral reach towards the amputated side and to a history of frequent falls.
