> Restoring somatosensory feedback to people with limb amputations is crucial to improve prosthetic control. Multiple studies have demonstrated that peripheral nerve stimulation and targeted reinnervation can provide somatotopically relevant sensory feedback. While effective, the surgical procedures required for these techniques remain a major barrier to translatability. Here, we demonstrate in four people with upper-limb amputation that epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a common clinical technique to treat pain, evoked somatosensory percepts that were perceived as emanating from the missing arm and hand. Over up to 29 days, stimulation evoked sensory percepts in consistent locations in the missing hand regardless of time since amputation or level of amputation. Evoked sensations were occasionally described as naturalistic (e.g. touch or pressure), but were often paresthesias. Increasing stimulus amplitude increased the perceived intensity linearly, without increasing area of the sensations. These results demonstrate the potential of SCS as a tool to restore somatosensation after amputations.

> Sensory restoration has been achieved using a variety of neural interfaces including epineural cuff electrodes like the spiral cuff (Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2020; Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014) and flat interface nerve electrode (Tan et al., 2014) or microelectrodes that penetrate the epineurium, such as the longitudinal intrafascicular electrode (Horch et al., 2011), transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (Raspopovic et al., 2014), or Utah slant array (Davis et al., 2016)

> Targeted sensory reinnervation is another approach that can allow vibrotactile or electrotactile feedback on the residual limb to be perceived as emanating from the missing limb (Marasco et al., 2011; Marasco et al., 2009). This is achieved by first surgically redirecting nerves that formerly innervated the missing limb to patches of skin on the residual limb or elsewhere, and then providing electrical or mechanical stimulation to the newly innervated site

> SCS leads are usually placed over the dorsal columns along the midline of the spinal cord which limits the evoked paresthesias to the proximal areas of the trunk and limbs

> Spinal cord stimulation – a technique where a small electrical device is inserted near the spinal cord to stimulate nerves – may be an easier alternative. This approach only requires a simple outpatient procedure, and it is routinely used to treat chronic pain conditions.

> In Subjects 2 and 3, most percepts were accompanied by a sensation on the residual limb. This was the case even when there was a percept that was focally restricted to a distal region of the missing limb

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> There were also a subset of mono- and multi-polar electrodes that evoked sensations bilaterally or only in the contralateral intact limb (14.3% and 15.4% of all electrodes that generated a sensation across all subjects; n = 447).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> There were notable similarities between the perceived locations and dermatomes (Foerster, 1933; Lee et al., 2008), however there was considerable inter-subject variability and sensations were not evoked in all regions of the hand in all subjects (Figure 2C).

> Percepts containing a dynamic (‘movement’) component that may be described as proprioceptive were evoked at least once in all subjects. Subjects were able to describe distinct proprioceptive sensations in the phantom limb such as opening and closing of the hand, movement of the thumb, and flexing of the elbow.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> To control for variability across different electrodes and across different testing sessions, we normalized each electrode to the mean of its response.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> We observed that as stimulation amplitude was increased, the perceived intensity of the sensory percept increased linearly for all subjects; an effect that was consistent across repetitions of the task on multiple days (Figure 4E).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> To examine the effect of stimulation amplitude on the area and intensity of the evoked percept, we computed the least-squares regression line for area versus stimulation amplitude and obtained the two-sided p-value (parea) for the null hypothesis that the slope of the regression line was zero.

> Across all subjects, the evoked percepts exhibited a median migration of 25.2 mm between weeks 1 and 2, 11.6 mm between weeks 2 and 3, and 9.9 mm between weeks 3 and 4. This week-to-week decrease in centroid migration follows the trend of decreased week-to-week vertical electrode migration (Figure 7B).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In all subjects, we were able to evoke sensory percepts that were focal and localized to the distal missing limb. Critically, this included people with amputations ranging from trans-radial through shoulder disarticulation.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> n our second and third subjects, distal sensations were often accompanied by a secondary sensation at the residual limb. It is unclear whether these secondary sensations are a result of neuroplastic changes in the representation of the amputated hand in the cortex or are a limitation of the selectivity of the SCS electrodes used in this study.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Factors that may limit stimulation selectivity with our approach include the thickness of the cerebrospinal fluid in the subdural space and the relatively large size of the contacts on the SCS leads. Consequently, the sensory percepts evoked in this study were sometimes more diffuse than those reported in other studies using peripheral neurostimulation approaches (Charkhkar et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2016; Raspopovic et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2015).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The relationship between the locations of the electrodes and that of the evoked percepts showed marked inter-subject variability and deviation from expected dermatomes.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Every electrode tested across all four subjects demonstrated a statistically significant linear relationship between stimulation amplitude and perceived intensity. This is similar to what has been observed with peripheral nerve stimulation (Graczyk et al., 2016; Petrini et al., 2019b)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Interestingly, we observed JNDs to be proportional to the stimulation amplitude with higher stimulation amplitudes resulting in larger JNDs. Such a relationship between JNDs and stimulus amplitude is consistent with Weber’s law which governs the behavior of most peripheral sensory receptors (Go ̈ s, 1959).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> We too, did not uncover a reliable way to evoke naturalistic sensation during the course of this study. Thus, the choice of electrodes and stimulation parameters would have to be optimized for each individual user to evoke percepts with the desired modalities (Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2019)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> It is worth noting that we did not anchor these leads to any bony structures or nearby tissue. Future permanently implanted systems for restoring sensation using SCS can utilize these anchoring techniques and thereby reduce or eliminate lead migration (Mekhail et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The stability in the electrodes is reflected in the stability of the evoked percepts. In the hand region, we observed a migration of evoked percepts of 10–25 mm, which is similar to the shift reported in peripheral stimulation approaches (Tan et al., 2015

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> A major advantage of the percutaneous approach described here is that there is a relatively low barrier to initiating clinical studies because the electrodes are commercially available from multiple manufacturers and the surgical procedures are commonly performed at most major medical centers. However, this reliance on commercially available electrodes also likely limited selectivity and focality

For Subjects 1-3, the first phase of stimulation was cathodic, while for Subject 4, an error in the stimulation control code caused the first phase of stimulation to be anodic.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Each descriptor had an associated scale ranging from 0 to 10 to record the corresponding perceived intensity. Additionally, the subject was instructed to rate the naturalness (0–10) and the depth of the perceived location of the percept (on or below the skin, or both)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> For each trial, subjects were allowed to report more than one descriptor simultaneously. Each unique combination of ‘mechanical’, ‘movement’, and ‘tingle’ descriptors was considered a separate modality for the evoked percept.
