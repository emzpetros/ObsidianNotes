> In daily life, humans are bombarded with visual input. Yet, their attentional capacities for processing this input are severely limited. Several studies have investigated factors that inﬂuence these attentional limitations and have identiﬁed methods to circumvent them. Here, we provide a review of these ﬁndings. We ﬁrst review studies that have demonstrated limitations of visuospatial attention and investigated physiological correlates of these limitations. We then review studies in multisensory research that have explored whether limitations in visuospatial attention can be circumvented by distributing information processing across several sensory modalities. Finally, we discuss research from the ﬁeld of joint action that has investigated how limitations of visuospatial attention can be circumvented by distributing task demands across people and providing them with multisensory input. We conclude that limitations of visuospatial attention can be circumvented by distributing attentional processing across sensory modalities when tasks involve spatial as well as object-based attentional processing. However, if only spatial attentional processing is required, limitations of visuospatial attention cannot be circumvented by distributing attentional processing. These ﬁndings from multisensory research are applicable to visuospatial tasks that are performed jointly by two individuals. That is, in a joint visuospatial task requiring object-based as well as spatial attentional processing, joint performance is facilitated when task demands are distributed across sensory modalities. Future research could further investigate how applying ﬁndings from multisensory research to joint action research may facilitate joint performance. Generally, ﬁndings are applicable to real-world scenarios such as aviation or car-driving to circumvent limitations of visuospatial attention.

> The general finding across studies is that with an increasing number of targets, performance in the MOT task systematically decreases (see Figure 1B), suggesting a limit of visuospatial attentional resources

> n sum, the findings discussed above suggest that the allocation of attentional resources across sensory modalities (i.e., whether they are shared or distinct) depends on what type of attentional processing is required in a task.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> In particular, if tasks only require spatial attentional processing, findings suggest that attentional resources are shared across sensory modalities (Wahn and König, 2015a,b). However, if tasks also require object-based attentional processing, findings suggest that attentional resources are distinct across the sensory modalities
