> Functional recovery for people with lower limb amputations is quantified using objective or subjective measures of performance. In this brief report, the prospective relationship between objective and subjective mobility after rehabilitation was evaluated in people with lower limb amputations. Adults undergoing inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation for a first unilateral transtibial or transfemoral level lower limb amputation were recruited. Assessment times: discharge and 4-mo follow-up. Gait velocity and the L Test under single- and dual-task conditions measured objective mobility. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (section 4 and question 5b) measured subjective mobility. Paired t tests and Pearson correlation analysis evaluated change over time and the association between mobility types, respectively. Twenty-one people with lower limb amputations (61.6 ± 8.2 yrs) participated. Gait velocity significantly improved (single- and dual-task: P < 0.001). L Test significantly improved for single-task (P = 0.002) but not dual-task conditions. No statistically significant Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire changes were observed. One subjective mobility question (sidewalk walking) correlated with objective mobility at follow-up (LTest single- and dual-task: r = −0.77; P < 0.001). Objective mobility improved after discharge; however, subjective reporting had no change. Lack of association may represent a mismatch between quantitative outcomes and subjective self-assessment. Both subjective and objective measures of mobility should be collected to provide a holistic picture of clinical and patient-relevant outcomes in people with lower limb amputations.

> Importantly, adequate walking is associated with higher social functioning2 and is the most important factor influencing quality of life in PLLA.3

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, objective mobility tests in controlled environments may not accurately reflect PLLA’sperception of their own ability to move within their community. For instance, clinical settings include bright lighting and exemplar conditions (e.g., dry floors, no obstacles), yet real-life involves complex environments (e.g., walking outside).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Subjective mobility tests are useful as they allow for the assessment of perceived mobility in scenarios difficult or impossible to test in clinical settings. Subjective tests tailored to specific patient populations offer a patient-centered view of ability and relevant outcomes

> Gait velocity (centimeter per second) was recorded using the GAITRite instrumented walkway (6  0.64 m; CIR System Inc, Franklin, NJ). One-meter distances before and after the walkway boundaries were used to account for acceleration and deceleration.

> Functional mobility was assessed using the LTest of Functional Mobility (L Test).16

> Dual-task testing required participants to perform serial subtractions by threes from a random number between 100 and 150 while walking

> Gait velocity significantly increased for both single-task (discharge: 52.5 ± 26.5 cm/sec, follow-up: 69.6 ± 26.1 cm/sec; P < 0.001) and dual-task (discharge: 42.3 ± 24.0 cm/sec, follow-up: 59.6 ± 28.7 cm/sec; P < 0.001) conditions (Fig. 1).

> L Test performance significantly improved for the single-task (discharge: 79.2 ± 51.5 secs, follow-up: 55.0 ± 39.7 secs; P = 0.002), but not for the dual-task (discharge: 100.1 ± 75.1 secs, follow-up: 63.6 ± 44.1 secs; P > 0.003) condition (Fig. 2).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> None of the 14 Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire questions demonstrated a statistically significant change between discharge and the 4-mo follow-up (P > 0.003; Table 2).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Previous research by Roepke et al.24 demonstrated that for individuals with dysvascular lower limb amputation, social participation is influenced by physical factors, but satisfaction with mobility is influenced by psychosocial factors.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> If baseline expectations used to assess self-perception of abilities changes with rehabilitation, individuals may report their abilities to be the same even when large performance improvements are observed.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Obtaining both objective and subjective measures, rather than individual measures alone, may allow for a more accurate representation of an individual’s abilities in this population. In addition, and based on results from the current study, inferring objective ability from subjective scores, or vice versa, may not be appropriate in PLLA.
