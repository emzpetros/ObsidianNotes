> role of proprioceptive input from the legs for the maintenance of upright human posture ischemia was bilaterally applied at the level of the ankle or the thigh

> Visual stabilization was excluded by eye closure.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The results indicate that proprioceptive input from skin, pressure and joint receptors of the foot (ischemia at the ankle) is of minor importance for the compensation of rapid displacements, but plays a significant role when the platform moves at low frequencies

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The working range of the visual system in the frequency domain can easily be examined be eye closure and has been shown to range below 1 Hz for postural stabilizationS,6

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The working range of the vestibular system is supposed to be covered for high frequencies by the semicircular canals and for low frequencies by the otoliths t6-tS.

> The sensitivity for vibration or tactile stimuli and the position sense of the big toe and the ankle joint were also tested.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> last trial was performed 42-43 min after inflation of the cuff. After this interval subjects could neither discriminate any tactile stimuli nor vibration or joint displacements

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Despite considerable interindividual differences between the 4 subjects (rows 1-4), there is a close similarity of the induced sway within one subject throughout the entire experiment

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Body sway, as measured by the root mean squares of the entire power spectrum and the amplitude of the dominant peak of the stimulus-dependent sway of CFP, head and hip, increased with increasing time of ischemia also at the level of the ankle (Table I).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Visual information obviously compensates for the loss of proprioceptive afferences from below the level of ischemia

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Ischemia at the level of the thigh led to a faster increase of body sway than ischemia at the level of the ankle.

<mark style="background-color: #e56eee">Quote</mark>
> Beyond 17 rain of ischemia one after another of the subjects had to give up due to rapidly developing paresis. Statistics, like with the lower level ischemia, were therefore not possible

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Sudden ramp movements of the measuring platform, even without visual information, are equally well compensated with and without afferent information from the skin of the foot and the ankle joint.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The very same afferents contribute significantly to postural stabilization in the lower frequency domain (0.3 Hz) when the platform is sinusoidally displaced.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Ischemia at the level of the ankle causes a significant increase of the displacement of the center of foot pressure with low frequency sinusoidal stimulation.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Ischemia at the level of the thigh was applied in order to suppress group I afferents under preservation of the efferent innervation of leg muscles.

> Using sinusoidal stimuli at 0.3 Hz, we observed a strong anterior-posterior 1 Hz component of sway just as Mauritz and Dietz 14
