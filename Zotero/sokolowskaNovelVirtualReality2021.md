> Functional lateralization relates to a natural asymmetry in the dominance right or left body side, and is a fundamental principle of the brain. The hemispheres of the brain control the contralateral body side, and show subtle, yet striking, anatomical asymmetries and functional lateralization. Innovative technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), are entering the areas of experimental research, modeling and simulation related to the study of lateralization, with new perspectives of different applications in modern medical practice. Researchers/ clinicians note that there are fewer VR studies with healthy participants, and which are important in evaluating/ interpreting clinical outcomes, and testing the usefulness, limitations, and sensitivity of VR. The presented in­ fluence of the domination of upper/lower limbs on the performance of VR exercises was studied in healthy righthanded adults. Virtual testing sessions were performed independently with both/ dominant/ non-dominant hands, and the similar VR sessions were conduced on a Wii Balance Board (WBB) with the choice of body side, at different levels of the difficulty. The obtained results are consistent with other studies which show that cognitive-motor training in VR with the WBB platform is a very sensitive and promising tool for recognizing/ assessing functional asymmetries of the right-left body side not only in disturbed lateralization, but also in the test training of healthy subjects.

These studiesproposed novel and creative solutions and clinical or experimental approaches using VR.

> Overall, as expected, better results were achieved for the full motion range to control the crosshair’s movement, and lower scores were obtained for the one-sided ranges. Significantly lower results were observed for left-sided deflections and they were statistically significantly in comparison with the right-side ones.

> Similarto manual sessions, the results suggest that following the butterfly’s trajectory is a more sensitive exercise in identifying the dominant body side, and revealingfunctional asymmetries of postural control.

> Moreover, the review of many research showed that there is no , “gold standard” for the use of VR settings and procedures in medical practice or in daily activities of patients, nevertheless positive and beneficial effects are documented in numerous studies, but further research is still needed.

> In the BALLS exercise, it was necessary to knock down colored balls, according to the rule displayed in a frame on the monitor screen. At higher difficulty levels, the task time was shorterand the numberof balls were increased. The subjects received points for each correctly thrown ball. The BUTTERFLY exercise was following a butterfly ’s trajectory, which was unpredictable and chaotic. There were also various distractors, i.e. distracting elements, which moved like the butterfly. The butterfly’s speed and trajectory varied with the difficulty level. The participants received points for every second in which they managed to keep the hand or crosshair(i.g. “posturographic marker”) on the moving butterfly.
