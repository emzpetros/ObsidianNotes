> Purpose: To investigate the internal consistency, convergent and known-groups construct validity of the Figure-of-Eight Walk Test with two novel conditions in persons with lower limb amputation, and to examine differences in walking performance between the three conditions within a group of persons with transtibial amputation and transfemoral amputation/knee disarticulation.

> Three Figure-of-Eight Walk Test conditions were investigated: 1) walking at a self-selected walking speed, 2) walking while carrying a tray with two cups of water, and 3) walking on uneven terrain.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Comparison between groups showed a difference between transtibial and transfemoral amputation/knee disarticulation participants when it comes to the Figure-of-Eight Walk Test time and smoothness parameters in Condition 2

> Being able to navigate in different environmental situations is a multitask activity that requires planning and attention [5].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Cognitive flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing environmental situations are therefore crucial to successful ambulation [6–9].

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Walking with prosthesis is physically and cognitively demanding [10]. Many persons with lower limb amputation have reported the need to “concentrate on every step,” and this may reflect increased use of cognitive resources [11].

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Cognition has an impact on walking performance, and the current literature on lower limb amputation recognises this relationship [12–16].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Various cognitive tasks such as serial subtractions or the Stroop test have been used together with walking tasks in dual-task assessments among persons with lower limb amputation [6,7,20–22].

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The results indicate that adding a concurrent cognitive task decreases performance in both walking and cognitive performance [22] and a decrease is observed regardless of etiology of amputation, or time since amputation [13]

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The ability to turn, while avoiding barriers or navigating the streets, is common and frequent situations in community mobility [25,26] that require cognitive processing.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Furthermore, curved-path walking involves complex motion strategies, thereby involving different cognitive processing than straight-path walking [26]. The body’s centre of mass shifts to the inner foot with an increase in stance time, which is challenging for people with lower limb amputation [5,23,26].

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The increased time and number of steps needed to perform a turn are related to an increased risk of falling [27]; thus, a performance-based test that incorporates turns and curved-path walking may be a clinically relevant test of mobility for persons with lower limb amputation.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The Figure-of-Eight Walk Test (F8W) developed by Hess et al. [5] is a test of curved-path walking designed to simulate the complexity of walking in daily life.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> These novel conditions are inspired by the description of environmental dimensions in prosthetic mobility, originally described by Hafner et al. [4]. These environmental dimensions are terrain, distance and time, obstacles, attentional demands, external loads, and ambient conditions.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Carrying objects has been reported to limit the mobility of persons with lower limb amputation due to the limited view of the prosthesis and reduced balance, and is thus considered a challenging situation [4,19].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Walking on uneven terrain may represent another type of challenge that requires increased attention for persons with lower limb amputation due to the need to compensate for the limited afferent input when walking on different surfaces [7].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> two selfreport instruments on mobility, i.e., the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUS-M) and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. In addition, performance-based measures of mobility, i.e., the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP), Ten-Meter Walk Test, and Six-Minute Walk Test were performed.

> several measures were not used, such as the Timed Up and Go test or L-test. Similar to the F8W, both of these tests include turns (two and four turns, respectively), but they also include the task “to rise from a chair,” which is not included in the F8W.

> The F8W time (measured with a stopwatch and timed to the nearest 100th of a second), the number of steps (rater counted) to complete the task, as well as the smoothness of walking, were recorded for each condition.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Each of the F8W parameters was averaged over the five trials.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The Friedman test revealed significant differences in F8W parameters (time, steps, and smoothness) between the walking conditions within the group of persons with transtibial amputation (p < 0.001) and the group of persons with transfemoral amputation/knee disarticulation (p < 0.001).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> F8W parameters in the two novel conditions were significantly different from the original F8W, which suggest that the two novel conditions may pose different challenges to persons with lower limb amputation when compared to the original F8W.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> According to Coman and Richardson [36], the correlation between self-report and performance-based outcome measures is generally moderate (r < 0.50),

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In contrast to Hafner et al. [39], the present results show a tendency towards a ceiling effect of the PLUS-M T-score, which underscores that the participants in the current study had a relatively high mobility level.

> . Overall, most of the F8W parameters were different (p < 0.05) in Condition 2 between persons with transtibial amputation and transfemoral amputation/knee disarticulation, but this was not the case for conditions 1 and 3.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Surprisingly, our results did not show a difference between transtibial amputation and transfemoral amputation/knee disarticulation in Condition 3, walking on soft and uneven terrain.

> The research was conducted in a laboratory setting, which may not necessarily reflect mobility situations in daily life.
