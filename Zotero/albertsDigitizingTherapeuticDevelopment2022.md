> Augmented reality (AR) may be a useful tool for the delivery of dual-task training. This manuscript details the development of the Dual-task Augmented Reality Treatment (DART) platform for individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and reports initial feasibility, usability, and efﬁcacy of the DART platform in provoking dual-task interference in individuals with PD. The DART platform utilizes the head-mounted Microsoft HoloLens2 AR device to deliver concurrent motor and cognitive tasks. Biomechanical metrics of gait and cognitive responses are automatically computed and provided to the supervising clinician. To assess feasibility, individuals with PD (N = 48) completed a bout of single-task and dual-task walking using the DART platform. Usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale (SUS). Dual-task interference was assessed by comparing single-task walking and walking during an obstacle course while performing a cognitive task. Average gait velocity decreased from 1.06 to 0.82 m/s from single- to dual-task conditions. Mean SUS scores were 81.3 (11.3), which placed the DART in the “good” to “excellent” category. To our knowledge, the DART platform is the ﬁrst to use a head-mounted AR system to deliver a dual-task paradigm and simultaneously provide biomechanical data that characterize cognitive and motor performance. Individuals with PD were able to successfully use the DART platform with satisfaction, and dual-task interference was provoked. The DART platform should be investigated as a platform to treat dual-task declines associated with PD.

> Overall, these projects indicate that the positional data from the HL1 is of sufficient quality and quantity to accurately characterize lower extremity performance. Gait velocity, step length, cadence [18,20], locomotion distance [18], and head movement [21] outcomes from the HL1 were comparable to the same outcomes derived from various motion capture systems in healthy individuals.

> In PD, gait velocity, step length, and cadence calculated from the HL1 were comparable to a motion capture system [20]. Turning is a complex motor skill that is associated with fall risk in older adults [22] and PD [23]; thus, quantifying fall metrics using a head-mounted AR device to assess turning behavior has been recently evaluated [24].

> The results indicated that the HL2 provided valid measures of turn duration and turn velocity [24].

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> While multiple theories on the underlying pathophysiology of dual-task interference in PD exist [26], it is likely that decreased gait automaticity associated with PD results in increased attentional resources being utilized for gait.

> A portion of the protocol included a bout of single-task forward walking followed by navigation of a digital obstacle course while performing a language task. For the language task, participants were delivered five words, of which four of the five were related (i.e., run, walk, sleep, jump, and crawl). The participant was asked to verbalize the word that was unrelated to the other four (i.e., sleep). A standard response time of five seconds was used across all participants prior to the start of the next word grouping
