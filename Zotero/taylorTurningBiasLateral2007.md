> Turning bias indices in the amputee sample were not significantly associated with handedness, footedness, side of amputation, or dominance prior to amputation. The lack of a preferred direction of turn in the amputee sample suggests that biomechanical asymmetries can influence turning bias.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Approximately 80  90% of humans are right-handed, 60  80% are rightfooted, and 80% of participants have a dominant hand and foot on the same side (Coren, 1992).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Certain gait asymmetries have been suggested as being linked to lateral dominance. For example, during walking, right-footed participants utilise the right limb to propel the body and the left limb to stabilise (Sadeghi, Allard, & Duhaime, 1997).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Recent work (Golmer & Mbongo, 2004) has reported, regardless of visual conditions, that left-footed participants displace the centre of pressure towards the outside of the supporting foot, whereas right-side-dominant participants displaced it towards the right side, regardless of whether the right or left foot was supporting. This led Golmer and Mbongo (2004) to conclude that postural control was regulated differently for the left-footed participants (through perception of the centre of body mass) compared to the right-footed participants (asymmetrical utilisation of head receptors).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Thus the aim of this study was to assess if lateral dominance changes following amputation, and the effect a biomechanical asymmetry has on turning bias.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The whole-body measure of assessing turning bias (Yazgan et al., 1996) required each participant to walk from a mark towards a mark 12 metres away (room dimensions  /15  /8 m), stop with feet approximately shoulderwidth apart, turn around and walk back towards the mark at the other end, and repeat the procedure, resulting in 10 turning events (for the amputees this was as many times as comfortable).

> he tester and the video camera were deliberately placed at opposite ends of the line of progression in order to counter each other’s presence.

> No lateral illumination in the form of either windows or artificial lights was present,

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Turning bias was scored according to a turning bias index, which was a percentage of left turns (number of left turns/total number of turns, multiplied by 100). A level of 60% was set as the cut-off for left bias, and this was in agreement with Yazgan et al. (1996). Indices between 60% and 100% indicated a left bias, between 0% and 40% indicated a right bias, and 41 59% no bias. The criterion was used for both amputee and ablebodied samples.

> Questions 11 (Is there any reason why you have changed your foot preference? ) was reworded to: Following amputation have you noticed/can you remember changing your foot preference? Question 12 (Have you ever been given special training or encouragement to use a particular foot for certain activities? ) was also re-worded to: Other than gait training, have you been given any special encouragement to use a particular foot for certain activities?

> As a group, the intact limb was the preferred limb for 19 of the amputees (binomial test, p / .200). The intact limb (right) was the dominant limb for the majority of participants with a left amputation (n  / 10, binomial test, p / .002). The preferred lower limb for those participants with a right amputation (N  /18) was more varied with 44%, x2 (2, n  /8)  / 1.33, p  / .513, choosing the intact limb, 33% equal preference, and 22% choosing the amputated limb.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Right-side dominance (hand and foot) was only prevalent in 40% of the sample, compared to 91% for the able-bodied sample, suggesting that 50% of amputees altered foot dominance following amputation.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The able-bodied sample tended towards a left-preferential turn with a turning bias index of 66.8%.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Individually, all amputees reported a turning preference: as a group the amputees showed no bias for turning (turning bias index / 47.4%). A onesample t-test revealed no significant difference from 50% (Table 2), indicating that amputees as a sample did not possess a preferred directional bias.

> . A trend of turning towards the amputated side was also noted when separating the amputees into side of amputation, with 10/16 (binomial test,p / .549) right-side amputees and 7/11 (binomial test,p / .454) left-side amputees preferring to turn to the amputated side. A similar trend was also noted with those amputees who reported the intact limb as the dominant limb (n  /16) with nine preferring to turn towards the amputated side.

> However, the turning bias index for the amputee sample differed significantly from the able-bodied sample, F (3, 128)  / 3.07, MSE  / 1592.7, p B/.05.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Generally, an extra step or steps were taken prior to turning compared to able-bodied participants. When turning to the amputated side the amputees took one step more on average than when turning toward the amputated limb (Figures 1b & 1c).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, females were significantly more likely than males to turn towards the same direction 100% of the time. This adds support to Bracha et al. (1987a), who stated that females were more lateralised than males for turning behaviour.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> However, for the amputee sample there was no significant preference towards turning away from the dominant hand or foot. This is likely due to their unusual pattern of footedness. Only 47% reported a right foot dominance, 23% illustrated ambi-sidedness, and 30% illustrated a left foot dominance. The pattern of footedness was to be expected since a number of amputees reported that their dominant limb was on the same side as their intact limb. However, turning bias was also not significantly associated with the side of amputation, with 59% of amputees preferring to turn towards their prosthetic side.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> This present study kept foot placement constant prior to the turn, therefore suggesting that anthropometrical asymmetries, which lead to biomechanical asymmetries, also influenced turning bias.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> With the dominant foot (right) rooted to the ground, acting as a stabiliser, the non-dominant (left) leg was mobilised into the new direction.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Turning away from the stance limb (step turn) ensures balance is maintained by keeping the centre of mass (CM) between both limbs. However, when turning towards the stance limb (pivot/crossover turn), the CM displaces outside the base of support, threatening balance (Taylor, Dabnichki, & Strike, 2005).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> For the amputee sample a trend of turning towards the prosthetic side was noted, allowing the intact limb to act as stabiliser during the initiation of the turn. Because of the loss of the ankle, possible adaptations are made to those tasks that demand increased postural control by employing the intact limb.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> With regards to turning bias, Bracha et al. (1987b) reported that these patients spontaneously rotate towards the side that is believed to contain the lower levels of dopamine. Thus these patients turned away from the more rigid side. This suggests that the less affected side provided stability, as the more rigid side was mobilised, similar to the amputee sample in this present work, who used the intact limb to provide support.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> This is because turning bias has also been reported to be opposite to the hemisphere with the most active dopamine system (Bracha et al., 1987b). It has also been suggested that turning bias is influenced by visuospatial functioning (Gordon et al., 1992; Mohr et al., 2004), fluctuation of ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle (Mead & Hampson, 1997), and vestibular asymmetries (Previc & Saucedo, 1992).
