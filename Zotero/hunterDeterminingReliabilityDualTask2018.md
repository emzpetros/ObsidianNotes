> Objective: To determine the relative and absolute reliability of a dual-task functional mobility assessment. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Academic rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Individuals (NZ60) with lower extremity amputation attending an outpatient amputee clinic (mean age, 58.21Æ12.59y; 18, 80% male) who were stratiﬁed into 3 groups: (1) transtibial amputation of vascular etiology (nZ20); (2) transtibial amputation of nonvascular etiology (nZ20); and (3) transfemoral or bilateral amputation of any etiology (nZ20). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Time to complete the L Test measured functional mobility under single- and dual-task conditions. The addition of a cognitive task (serial subtractions by 3’s) created dual-task conditions. Single-task performance on the cognitive task was also reported. Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients (ICCs) measured relative reliability; SEM and minimal detectable change with a 95% conﬁdence interval (MDC95) measured absolute reliability. Bland-Altman plots measured agreement between assessments.
Results: Relative reliability results were excellent for all 3 groups. Values for the dual-task L Test for those with transtibial amputation of vascular etiology (nZ20; mean age, 60.36Æ7.84y; 19, 90% men) were ICCZ.98 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], .94e.99), SEMZ1.36 seconds, and MDC95Z3.76 seconds; for those with transtibial amputation of nonvascular etiology (nZ20; mean age, 55.85Æ14.08y; 17, 85% men), values were ICCZ.93 (95% CI, .80e.98), SEMZ1.34 seconds, and MDC95Z3.71 seconds; and for those with transfemoral or bilateral amputation (nZ20; mean age, 58.21Æ14.88y; 13, 65% men), values were ICCZ.998 (95% CI, .996e.999), SEMZ1.03 seconds, and MDC95Z2.85 seconds. Bland-Altman plots indicated that assessments did not vary systematically for each group.
Conclusions: This dual-task assessment protocol achieved approved levels of relative reliability values for the 3 groups tested. This protocol may be used clinically or in research settings to assess the interaction between cognition and functional mobility in the population with lower extremity amputation.

Similarly, the relative test-retest reliability of the dual-task protocol was excellent across all groups tested. ICC values for each group are as follows: TTA of vascular etiology, ICCZ.98 (95% CI, .94e.99); TTA of nonvascular etiology, ICCZ.93 (95% CI, .80e.98); and TFA or bilateral amputation, ICCZ.998 (95% CI, .996e.999).
