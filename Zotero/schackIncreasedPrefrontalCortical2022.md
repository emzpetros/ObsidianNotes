> [!Abstract]

> Background: Lower limb amputation (LLA) alters the sensorimotor control systems. Despite the self-reports of increased attention during mobility, the interaction between mobility and cognitive control mechanisms is not fully understood.
Objective: Concurrently evaluate walking performance and prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity in persons with and without LLA during different walking conditions.
Methods: Thirty-nine persons with LLA and thirty-three able-bodied controls participated. Walking performance was evaluated using the Figure-of 8-walk-test during three conditions: 1) UW (Usual walking with self-selected walking speed); 2) WCT (walking and carrying a tray with two cups filled with water); and 3) WUT (walking on uneven terrain). PFC activity was assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Linear mixed models were used to detect changes between groups and between walking conditions within each group.
Results: Between-group comparisons showed increased PFC activity in persons with LLA during UW and WUT, and a significant decrease in walking performance during WCT and WUT compared to controls. Within-group comparisons showed increased PFC activity during WUT compared with UW and WCT and an overall difference in walking performance between the conditions (WU > WUT > WCT) in both groups. However, the effect of walking condition on PFC activity and walking performance was not modified by group (P > .1).
Conclusion: The results suggest that persons with LLA have increased attentional demands during walking but choose the same cognitive-mobility strategy during challenging walking conditions as able-bodied persons. However, the attentional demands seem to depend on the complexity of the task.

> dual-task studies in persons with LLA have mainly looked at cognitive and mobility performance and not on the underlying cortical activation during the performance.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Neuroimaging studies have revealed that several different cortical and subcortical regions are involved during walking (Hamacher et al., 2015)andtheliteraturedescribes two pathways (Bayot et al., 2018;Heroldetal.,2017): 1) a direct locomotor pathway (primary motor cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord); and 2) indirect locomotor pathway (prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor areas, and basal ganglia).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> During attentional demanding and challenging walking conditions, the activation of the indirect locomotor pathway increases and the PFC, in particular, plays a key role (Clark, 2015;Hamacheretal.,2015; Yogev-Seligmann, Hausdorff, and Giladi, 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, a decreased PFC activation has been observed in dual-task walking with a visual task in older persons (Beurskens, Helmich, Rein, and Bock, 2014) and during different complex walking paths in younger persons (Lin and Lin, 2016)
