> Background: Deficits in motor control can be observed with a decrease in plantar sensation. There is evidence that changing the plantar feedback leads to kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular adaptations in static as well as dynamic conditions. The effect of changes in plantar feedback on the modulation of gait has not been clarified conclusively.
Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to provide a review of studies reporting the effects of changes in plantar feedback on human gait characteristics.
Method: The databases Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) were searched for clinical (CTs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning foot sensation and gait.
Results: Twenty-three studies were included in the evaluation. Several methods were used to affect the sensitivity of the foot sole. After cooling or sedating the foot sole, predominant changes occur in decreased peak pressures, muscle activities and joint angles, and relocation of the centre of pressure under the foot was found. Walking on uneven surfaces results in a decrease in gait velocity, cadence and step length and also an increase in step variability. The use of textured insoles during walking leads to increased knee, hip and ankle angles, forces and moments in neurological patients with decreased foot sensation. In particular, individuals with sensory deficits show significant gait improvements when using textured or vibrating insoles.
Conclusions: Changes in plantar feedback lead to stimulation-specific adaptations of gait characteristics. Further prospective RCTs should be performed to investigate interventions for enhancing plantar receptor feedback for the prevention of falls and the treatment of injuries and movement disorders.

> As the foot sole is loaded first during ground contact, deficits in sensorimotor function, including plantar sensitivity, are considered to be related to adaptations of walking over irregular ground surfaces by an inability to detect these irregularities (Menant et al. 2009a). However, changes in gait pattern, such as a reduced gait velocity, an increased stride width, a higher stance-to-swing ratio and also longer latencies are considered to be predominantly caused by motor impairments (Petrofsky et al. 2005).

> Prolonged contact times of the total foot and several foot regions in addition to a more plane load distribution over the total foot indicated an early and prolonged flat position of the foot during gait. These findings demonstrated a relocation of loads from the toes and the heel to the central and lateral forefoot.

> Range of motion was reduced in the knee and increased in the hip during heel contact and push-off phase during gait. Acceleration and braking force peaks were significantly decreased and braking force peak was found to be delayed. Because of a lack of plantar feedback, touch-down and push-off were performed more cautiously under iced conditions so as to protect the foot. A decline in gait velocity after cooling the foot sole underlines this conclusion

> Although tactile and vibration thresholds were significantly increased, no differences in plantar pressure distribution or forces during gait were found. These results indicate the minor relevance of the cutaneous foot sole mechanoreceptors and a major role of intrinsic foot muscles and joint mechanoreceptors in the regulation of gait in diseases where a loss of plantar sensation is apparent.

> Furthermore, it was concluded that plantar sensitivity feedback provides information about foot contact so as to generate braking forces for decelerating the forward momentum of the centre of mass. In light of this, dynamic postural control impairments have been detected in subjects with chronic instabilities of the ankle, suggesting deficits in feedforward and feedback neuromuscular control

> Several investigations revealed that decreased plantar sensation leads to a more cautious foot contact, a prolonged contact time of the feet and a decreased gait velocity. Furthermore, the sensorimotor system appears to react to selective stimulation of foot sole receptors with an increase in forces and muscle activities during gait, particularly in individuals with sensory impairments.
