> [!Abstract]
>
> The purpose of these studies was to develop a reliable dual-task functional mobility protocol and investigate changes in dual-task performance over time in lower extremity amputees. Relative and absolute test-retest reliability of the protocol were evaluated across the population in a study consisting of three groups, with 20 participants per group. A pilot study of 16 participants investigated change in dual-task performance between discharge from rehabilitation and follow-up for both cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Gait was assessed by the developed protocol as well as an electronic walkway (GaitRITE®). All three groups in Study 1 had excellent relative test-retest reliability and comparable values for absolute test-retest reliability. Study 2 demonstrated that differences in gait and functional mobility exist between cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals. These changes are present at discharge from rehabilitation and persist at follow-up. However, improvement in gait and functional mobility is possible for both groups.

> Individuals with lower extremity amputations (LEA) caused by diabetes or vascular complications may face challenges associated with higher-order cognitive processes such as problem-solving, reasoning, concentration and balance (Coffey, O’Keeffe, Gallagher, Desmond, & Lombard-Vance, 2012).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The goals of prosthetic rehabilitation are often to improve mobility and activity levels, so measures of functional performance are particularly important (Treweek & Condie, 1998).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> There is an established trend that ambulatory ability of those with LEA improves between 6 weeks and 4 months following amputation and then plateaus (Czerniecki, Turner, Williams, Hakimi, & Norvell, 2012).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The amount of energy required to walk with a prosthetic device varies based on level and etiology of amputation. Individuals with a unilateral, traumatic BKA use approximately 25% more energy to walk compared to non-amputees (Braddom, 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The risk factors for falls in the general population include age, impaired vision, problems with motor control, impaired gait, poor balance, cognitive impairment and polypharmacy (Andersson, Kamwendo, Seiger, & Appelros, 2006; Kulkarni, Toole, Hirons, Wright, & Morris, 1996; Tinetti, Speechley, & Ginter, 1988).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Other falls risk factors have been identified that are unique to individuals with LEA (Hunter et al., 2017). These factors include: a dysvascular etiology of amputation, a reduced sense of vibration, the period following rehabilitation for those with AKAs and the period following surgery for those with BKAs (Hunter et al., 2017).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Despite the best efforts and functional gains in prosthetic-rehabilitation programs, the falls risk for older adults with an LEA exceeds that for frail older adults living in the community (Miller, Speechley, et al., 2001b)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Individuals with lower limb amputation are at risk for cognitive impairment due to the increased age at which the majority of amputations are occurring and to the etiology of amputations for these older individuals (Nowygrod et al., 2006). For instance, increasing age is associated with impairments in memory, attention, reasoning and problem solving (Park, 2000)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The prevalence of cognitive impairment in the amputee population has been reported to be between 8-56% (Coffey et al., 2012; Frengopoulos et al., 2017)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Some authors have outlined the domains of memory, attention, concentration, visuospatial abilities and organization to be of particular importance (Hanspal & Fisher, 1991; O’Neill & Evans, 2009).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Relative to the general population, those with dysvascular amputations are at an increased risk for impairment in the areas of problem-solving, reasoning and concentration (Coffey et al., 2012).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The ability to constantly adapt sensorimotor patterns to safely navigate in one’s environments is key for mobility (Hausdorff, 2005; Patla & Shumway-Cook, 1999). This ability to adapt requires interactions between the central nervous system, specifically higher levels of cognitive processing, the musculoskeletal system and the somatosensory system (Woollacott & Shumway-Cook, 2002).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> One gait cycle is also called a stride, and consists of two steps (Braddom, 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> As walking speed increases, double stance time begins to decrease; it becomes 0% of the cycle when running begins (Kirtley, Whittle, & Jefferson, 1985).

> five broad domains of gait: rhythm, phase, variability, pace, and base of support (Hollman, Mcdade, & Petersen, 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> first domain, rhythm, is focused on the temporal aspects of gait, the first of which is cadence (Hollman et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Step time and also fall under this domain, as do swing times, stance time and single limb support time (Hollman et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> variability domain of gait encompasses all variability parameters of gait, excluding step width variability. These parameters are most commonly measured as the coefficient of variation (%CV) and include the following: stride time and length variability, step time and length variability, swing and stance time variability, and stride speed variability (Hollman et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> pace, consists of two spatial parameters (stride length and step length) and the temporal-spatial parameter of gait speed (Hollman et al., 2011)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The walking base, also known as the base of support or step width, is a spatial component of gait; measured as the side to side distance between the two feet (Whittle, 2007).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Among people with a unilateral LEA this compensation may be seen as an increase

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> 10 stance time on the non-prosthetic side, an earlier terminal stance due to loss of active plantar flexion in the ankle or a vaulting of the normal leg during swing of the prosthesis (Whittle, 2007).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The level of amputation also has an impact on gait, as above knee prostheses are harder to control than below knee prostheses (Braddom, 2011; DeLisa, 2010; Whittle, 2007).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Other differences that may be observed in amputee gait include longer cycle times and decreased speed compared to non-amputees (Whittle, 2007). Additionally, a wider stance may also be utilized to improve stability (

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> When using these systems, only gait information from the feet can be collected and analyzed. Information on alignment of the lower limbs and pelvis as well as changes occurring in the torso or upper limbs are not accounted for

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Stride velocity is inversely related to stride variability; a decrease in velocity causes an increase in stride variability (Dubost et al., 2006; Heiderscheit, 2000).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Low stride-to-stride variability points to safe and efficient gait control that requires minimal cognitive demands, in particular in the domain of attention (Hausdorff, 2004; Hausdorff, Rios, & Edelberg, 2001; Hausdorff, Yogev, Springer, Simon, & Giladi, 2005; Maki, 1997).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> cognition will be defined as mental processes involved in acquiring, storing, using and manipulating knowledge (Matlin, 1998).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Executive functions are higher order cognitive processes responsible for the control and regulation of other cognitive processes (Miyake, Friedman, et al., 2000; Yogev et al., 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Attention is a term that represents a number of processes related to how an individual becomes receptive to stimuli and how they begin processing this information (Lezak, 1995)

> Working memory is a complex concept that refers to a set of short-term information processing systems (Baddeley, Logie, Bressi, Della Sala, & Spinnler, 1986).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Control of stepping, including stride time and stride length, mainly depend on communication between the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia and spinal central pattern generators (CPGs) (Newell & Corcos, 1993; Nutt et al., 1993; Whittle, 2007).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> CPGs are rhythm generating systems that are controlled by neural input from higher brain centres, and receive feedback from sensors in the muscles and joints of the legs (Dietz, 2003; Duysens & Van De Crommert, 1998).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Gait speed is associated with performance on executive functions and memory tests as both depend on prefrontal cortex activation, indicating a sharing of neural pathways (Alvarez & Emory, 2006; Holtzer et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2004; Suzuki, Miyai, Ono, & Kubota, 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The principle of dual-task gait assessment is to compare the simultaneous performance of mobility and cognitive tasks to performance on each task independently (Abernethy, 1988; Pashler, 1994).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Peripheral overload is one theory that may lend explanation for what is observed under dual-task conditions (Beauchet & Berrut, 2006). This theory suggests that similarity between tasks reduces interference, leading to better performance; this is also referred to as a cross-talk model (Beauchet & Berrut, 2006).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Another theory of cognitive-motor interference is the bottleneck theory (Yogev et al., 2008). This states that if two tasks need to be processed by the neural network, a bottleneck is created when handling the information (Yogev et al., 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The capacity sharing model offers a third explanation for what is observed under dualtask conditions (Beauchet & Berrut, 2006; Pashler, 1994; Treisman, 1969). This model postulates that the changes in gait result from capacity interference caused by competing demands for attention (Woollacott & Shumway-Cook, 2002).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> For example, cognitive tasks such as mental tracking or verbal fluency disturb gait more than reaction time tasks because they involve cognitive domains with known associations to gait (Al-Yahya et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Therefore, complex walking tasks reflect one’s ability to adapt motor patterns to challenging tasks and forces one to make sensorimotor adaptations to gait (Patla & Shumway-Cook, 1999; Woollacott & Shumway-Cook, 2002).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> n healthy young adults, stride velocity has been shown to decrease significantly under dual-task conditions compared to when walking alone, this is combined with an increase in stride-time variability (Dubost et al., 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Dual-task related changes in spatial and temporal gait parameters noted across the various populations listed above include: decreased speed, decreased cadence, decreased stride length, increased stride time and increased stride time variability (AlYahya et al., 2011; Yogev et al., 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Changes in gait related to dual-tasking are sensitive and may distinguish between groups of healthy participants from those with mild cognitive deficits or neurological conditions (Al-Yahya et al., 2011). This is only true of gait speed, and has not been shown for other gait parameters (Al-Yahya et al., 2011).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> One study showed that those with AKAs walked slower, had a wider step width and more asymmetrical gait under dual-task conditions, but these changes were not significant from those of normal controls (Morgan, Hafner, & Kelly, 2016). Another study of those with AKAs found slower gait speeds and longer strides under dual-task conditions (Lamoth, Ainsworth, Polomski, & Houdijk, 2010).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> There is variability in the instructions given, which may influence the participants prioritization strategy during dual-tasking (Yogev et al., 2008). Another concern is the lack of standardization of cognitive task type, making comparisons between studies difficult (Beauchet et al., 2009).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> There is also no established method for quantifying the level of attentional load during dual-tasking (Yogev et al., 2008).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Despite the best efforts and functional gains in prosthetic-rehabilitation programs, the falls risk for older adults with an LEA exceeds that for frail older adults living in the community (Miller, Speechley, et al., 2001b).

> Both single and dual-task L Tests were timed to the nearest 100th of a second in accordance with standard protocol (Deathe & Miller, 2005). To ensure sincerity of effort in performance on the secondary cognitive task, responses were recorded and accuracy of responses was calculated.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to quantify cognitive ability. The MoCA is a cognitive screening tool that provides a brief evaluation of 7 cognitive domains (Nasreddine et al., 2005).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> This agreement evaluates the accuracy of comparability between the two testing sessions (Altman & Bland, 1983). These plots are created by graphing the difference in test and retest times against the mean of the two testing times (Bland & Altman, 1986)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The cognitively impaired group walked 34.45 cm/s slower when performing single-task walking (p=0.011) and 38.10 cm/s slower under dual-task conditions (p=0.006). Individuals in the cognitively impaired group also spent more time in the double stance period of gait.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>

> A negative dual-task cost indicates poorer performance during dual-task conditions compared to single-task conditions.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> One participant in the cognitively impaired group performed the straight path assessment faster under dual-task conditions at follow-up; all other individuals had slower gait on straight path and complex path walk tests at follow-up.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However the current study expands upon previous work by creating a reliable dual-task version of the test. No prior study has established a reliable dual-task testing protocol for use in the LEA population. Study 1 also makes novel contributions regarding the MDC95, and these values can now be used to investigate change in dual-task performance overtime

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Results demonstrated that the cognitively normal group had faster gait under straight path single and dual-task conditions at both assessment time points.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, the cognitively impaired group did have higher variability in one gait parameter at discharge and one at follow-up.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> So while significant gains in gait velocity were made by the cognitively impaired group, they still walked at a slower pace under singletask conditions than established walkers in the community. However, the cognitively normal group had gait velocities and stride lengths similar to more experienced community ambulators upon discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. This highlights the functional differences in these groups at both discharge and follow-up.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The results from this study indicate that in general, gait variability does not change between single and dualtask conditions for either group in this study.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The lack of difference in gait variability between single-task and dual-task may indicate that LEA gait is more variable regardless of environmental conditions, however studies comparing normal controls and those with LEA are needed to confirm this.

Dual-task testing on both straight and complex paths in this study indicate that performance on gait decreases, while performance on the cognitive task may increase, decrease or remain the same

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
