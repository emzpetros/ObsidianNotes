> Introduction: Walking with a prosthesis while performing secondary tasks increases demand on cognitive resources, compromising balance and gait. This study investigated effects of a secondary task on patterns of brain activity and temporospatial gait parameters in individuals using a prosthesis with or without a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee(MPK) and controls.
Methods: A cross-sectional study with repeated measures was performed. Twenty-nine individuals with amputations and 16 controls were recruited. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate changes in oxygenated and de-oxygenated haemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex and temporospatial variables during single-and dual-task walking.
Results: Differences in brain activity were observed within the MPK-group and controls without changes in temporospatial parameters. The Trail-Walking test was associated with highest levels of brain activity in both groups. No differences were observed between single- and dual-task walking in the non-MPK-group (p > 0.05). The NonMPK and the MPK-group recorded higher levels of brain activity than controls during single-task walking and poorer results on temporospatial variables compared to controls.
Conclusions: For the MPK-group and controls, introduction of a secondary task led to an increase in brain activity. This was not seen in the Non-MPK-group. Significant differences in brain activity were observed in the absence of changes in temporospatial parameters.

> Condition 3 required that participants complete a modified Trail-Walking Test (TWT), which involved walking while circling a series of numbered cones that had been placed in a 1x4m area in a pre-determined, nonconsecutive order. The TWT has been shown to predict increased risk of falling in healthy, elderly individuals.16
