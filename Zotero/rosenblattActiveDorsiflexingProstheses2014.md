> People with amputation are at increased risk of falling compared with age-matched, nondisabled individuals. This may partly reflect amputation-related changes to minimum toe clearance (MTC) that could increase the incidence of trips and fall risk. This study determined the contribution of an active dorsiflexing prosthesis to MTC. We hypothesized that regardless of speed or incline the active dorsiflexion qualities of the ProprioFoot would significantly increase MTC and decrease the likelihood of tripping. Eight people with transtibial amputation walked on a treadmill with their current foot at two grades and three velocities, then repeated the protocol after 4 wk of accommodation with the ProprioFoot. A mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare MTC. Curves representing the likelihood of tripping were derived from the MTC distributions and a multiple regression was used to determine the relative contributions of hip, knee, and ankle angles to MTC. Regardless of condition, MTC was approximately 70% larger with the ProprioFoot (p < 0.001) and the likelihood of tripping was reduced. Regression analysis revealed that MTC with the ProprioFoot was sensitive to all three angles, with sensitivity of hip and ankle being greater. Overall, the ProprioFoot may increase user safety by decreasing the likelihood of tripping and thus the pursuant likelihood of a fall.

> In a study by Miller et. al., over 50 percent of community-living people with amputation fell over the course of a year. In that same study, almost half of all community-living people with amputation reported a fear of falling [6]. Importantly, a fear of falling is associated with an increased risk of future falls [7].

> Theory predicts that small MTC and larger toe clearance variability increase the probability that the swing foot will contact an unseen obstacle, initiating a trip [12].

> For nondisabled individuals, decreased walking speed can decrease MTC [22] and faster walking speeds can increase the likelihood of a failed recovery (i.e., a fall) following a laboratory-induced trip [23]. The extent to which speed affects MTC in people with amputation is unknown.

> Subjects walked on a treadmill (ActiveStep; Lebanon, New Hampshire) at two grades, 0 percent (level) and 5 percent (incline), and at three walking velocities on each grade: self-selected velocity, 80 percent, and 120 percent of self-selected velocity.

> Values from the cumulative integration were normalized to the total area and plotted at 0.5 mm increments to obtain the equivalent of a cumulative probability distribution—a curve that ranges from values of 0 to 1.0 and describes the probability that MTC on any random step is less than or equal to a specific value.

> Regardless of the condition, MTC was nearly 70 percent larger when subjects wore the ProprioFoot.

> However, the extent to which this translates to increased safety in the community depends, in part, on the scope of the problem of trip-related falls by people with TTAs. Although trip-related falls are the leading fall-cause for nondisabled older adults [3,8–10], and one that is amenable to intervention [38], similar results have yet to be established in people with TTAs.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Even if a lower MTC increases the likelihood of contacting an obstacle, the occurrence of a trip-related fall thereafter is highly dependent on the reactive, compensatory stepping strategy [39–40].

> Of the two studies that have evaluated MTC variability of older adults with and without a history of falls, both reported significantly greater variability in those with a history of falls [13–14].
