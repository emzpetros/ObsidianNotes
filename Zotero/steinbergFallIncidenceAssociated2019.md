> Purpose: The objective of this study was to estimate fall incidence and describe associated risk factors among people with a lower limb amputation (LLA) during various stages of recovery: the surgical ward, in-patient rehabilitation and return to community life. Materials and methods: A systematic search of relevant English language articles was performed using PubMed and EMBASE. Out of 310 initial “hits,” six retrospective cohort studies, one prospective cohort study and eleven cross-sectional studies from which fall incidence and risk factors could be extracted, were selected for critical review. Fall incidence and associated risk factors were extracted and analyzed in the context of various clinical stages of recovery after amputation. The studies were evaluated for quality using the “Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.”
Results: Results showed that during all stages of recovery, people with a LLA are at increased risk of falling compared with able-bodied individuals, as well as other clinical populations. Each stage of recovery is associated with different fall risk factors. The current review is limited mainly by the paucity of studies on the topic.
Conclusions: Specialised care focusing on the most relevant risk factors for each stage of recovery may enhance fall prevention during post-fall recovery.

> The following risk factors of falls were identified: >70 years of age or cognitive impairment, each of which increased the chance of falling  1.5-fold compared to younger patients or those with no cognitive impairment. Also, patients with four or more comorbidities or taking two or more PRN medications, or using benzodiazepines or opiates on a PRN basis were twice to six times as likely to fall. The independent risk factors for multiple falls were similar to those for a single fall.

> Recently, Wong et al. [30] examined how self-reported balance ability (assessed by the Berg Balance Scale [33]), balance confidence, and prosthetic functional use are associated with fall history (in the past 12 months) and prosthetic functional use (Houghton score [34]

> The results for fall risk factors were seemingly paradoxical; participants with better balance ability had higher odds of falling (Table 3). According to the authors, these results can be explained by avoidance of activities and thus less falls among those with poor balance. This assumption was verified by informal discussion with the participants in the support groups.

> Concerning risk factors, the only variable found to be significantly correlated with the number of falls was poor vibration sense, such that participants with poor vibration sense experienced three times more falls than those with good vibration sense.

> the authors showed that fallers had greater gait variability than non-fallers. Increased gait variability was expressed, for example, in the variation of the swing times generated across the gait cycles in a given trial (see Table 3).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Regarding the differences between the fall and no-fall groups, logistic regression revealed a decrease in step regularity (i.e., increased gait variability) as the only significant gait variability or regularity variable related to fall history (p = 0.026).

> (1) at least four other medical problems [13,16,19] and (2) increased gait variability [22,25]

> Increased gait variability has been described as a risk factor for falls in elderly participants as well as in participants with neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Parkinson’s disease [40,41]). Gait variability has also been shown to be influenced by cognitive load [42,43]. In the case of people with a LLA, it might be speculated that the more participants need to focus their attention on gait due to the impairment which is expressed by increased gait variability, perhaps indicative of cognitive deficits [16].

> Second, during balance training of people with a LLA, it is suggested to target reducing the following specific factors: gait variability, excess confidence in balance and walking abilities, and less cautious stair walking.
