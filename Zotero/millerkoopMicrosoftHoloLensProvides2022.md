> [!Abstract]
>
> Augmented-reality (AR) headsets, such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2 (HL2), have the potential to be the next generation of wearable technology as they provide interactive digital stimuli in the context of ecologically-valid daily activities while containing inertial measurement units (IMUs) to objectively quantify the movements of the user. A necessary precursor to the widespread utilization of the HL2 in the ﬁelds of movement science and rehabilitation is the rigorous validation of its capacity to generate biomechanical outcomes comparable to gold standard outcomes. This project sought to determine equivalency of kinematic outcomes characterizing lower-extremity function derived from the HL2 and three-dimensional (3D) motion capture systems (MoCap). Sixty-six healthy adults completed two lower-extremity tasks while kinematic data were collected from the HL2 and MoCap: (1) continuous walking and (2) timed up-and-go (TUG). For all the continuous walking metrics (cumulative distance, time, number of steps, step and stride length, and velocity), equivalence testing indicated that the HL2 and MoCap were statistically equivalent (error ≤ 5%). The TUG metrics, including turn duration and turn velocity, were also statistically equivalent between the two systems. The accurate quantiﬁcation of gait and turning using a wearable such as the HL2 provides initial evidence for its use as a platform for the development and delivery of gait and mobility assessments, including the in-person and remote delivery of highly salient digital movement assessments and rehabilitation protocols.

> Similar to gait speed, the TUG is a reliable and valid measure of fall prediction in older adults [11].

> During the visit, participants performed two experimental tasks while kinematics data were collected concurrently with the MoCap and HL2 systems: (I) 60 s of continuous walking along an oval path (7 × 2 m walkway) at their preferred speed, and (II) TUG

> Gait duration (s) was the total time spent walking and Gait velocity (m/s) was calculated as the total distance traveled in the horizontal plane (m) divided by the Gait duration (s).

> Unlike the MoCap system, the angular rotation (Rz) of the headset about the vertical axis was a direct output from the HL2 system and, therefore, did not require calculation.

> The TOSTs determined that across all the gait outcomes, the HL2 measures were statistically equivalent (error ≤ 5%, p < 0.05) to the MoCap measures at a 95% confidence level (Table 2). Correspondingly, the reliability of the HL2 metrics for the continuous walking trials were found to be excellent, with all the ICC (2,1) values ≥0.98.

> The sit-to-walk duration, walk-to-sit duration, and peak turn velocity were not statistically equivalent between the two systems, although the absolute percentage difference for each measure was less than 5%.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> the data from the HL2 provided sufficient resolution to parse the TUG into meaningful components by providing granular biomechanical measures of movement patterns compared to the traditional, somewhat generic, total time to complete.

> Furthermore, validation should also be considered in individuals with atypical gait patterns.

> Specifically, our team is pursuing the utilization of AR technology to deliver a dual-task intervention to treat postural and gait deficits in individuals with PD and to assess mild traumatic brain injury.
