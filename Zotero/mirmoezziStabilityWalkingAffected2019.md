> Aims: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of walking speed and cognitive load on learning gait stability in younger and older adults. Materials and Methods: Ten adults (five males and five females) and ten elderly (five males and five females) were healthy volunteers without a history of falls. He was asked to do three tasks on a treadmill with speed (preferred, fast, and slow) with/without cognitive load. The gait‑stability ratio (GSR) for each of the above conditions was calculated in terms of both younger and older adults. Two‑way repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the mean differences at a significance level of 0.05. Results: The results showed that the cognitive performance score decreases with increasing speed. Moreover, at faster and slower speeds than prefer speed with/without cognitive load, GSR is higher, and this value was observed more in elderly than in adults (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The elderly, through different walking strategies, especially the lowering phase, provide more double support while walking, so that they will fall less with increasing steadiness.

> Dubost et al. reported the increase in walking variability in the elderly while performing simple computational tasks.[12] Lindenberger et al. found that dual-task disorders appear to increase with age, and disorders such as a decrease in walking speed and an increase in the number of wrong steps during walking seem to appear

> The cognitive performance scale (CPS) was calculated by Formula (1). Using this formula, the speed and precision of a person’s cognitive task are taken into account

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The higher the CPS indicates the weaker person’s cognitive performance (less correct answer) while dual-task walking and vice versa.

> Correct response rate = Response rate per second × Percent of correct answers response

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> This size includes gait-stability ratio (GSR), which is the cadence ratio (steps per second) to speed (m/s), whose unit is steps per meter. GSR expresses gait stability, and its increase shows the increase of steps per meter, meaning that the person has a double support level earlier and has better gait stability

> A post hoc test for comparing the means shows that increasing the walking speed without cognitive load has a negative effect on learning the gait stability in younger adults and older adults.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The results show that there is a significant difference in slow walking speed with/without cognitive load between age groups and the older adult has greater stability.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The results indicated that walking fast relative to walking slowly or at the preferential speed significantly worsen the cognitive performance.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Studies showed that the cost of the dual task for cognitive function increases with the motor task getting harder.[22]

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Cromwell and Newton argued that GSR levels are higher in the elderly, meaning that the elderly take more steps in the same distance, and hence their gait stability increases with this mechanism.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Although this process is automatic, using dual tasks, various studies have shown that tasks such as walking at different speeds and performing complex cognitive tasks need significant resources. Thus, there is always competition on limited resources for control posture and implementation of dual functional and cognitive tasks.[27
