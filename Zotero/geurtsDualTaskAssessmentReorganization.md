> GeurU ACH, Mulder TW, Nienhuis B, RUken RAJ. Dual-task assessment of reorganization of postural control in persons with lower limb amputation. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991;72:10S9-64. • Postural control in persons with lower limb amputation was studied using a cognitive approach to motor learning. The aim of this study was to show that an important characteristic of the central reorganization process after a lower limb amputation is the gradually decreasing need of attentional resources to perform a motor task. A dual-task procedure was developed to estimate the level of automaticity of a quiet, upright standing task. The effect of a concurrent attention-demanding task (Stroop task) on the efficiency of balance control was determined using forceplatform measurements at the start and the end of the rehabilitation process. In contrast with a control group, the amputation group showed interference effects on body sway caused by the concurrent task both at the start {p<M) and, less severe, at the end of rehabilitation (p<.05). Improvement of balance control was significant onty for the dual-task condition (p<.05j. The results corroborated the hypothesis that dual tasks give information about the restoration of automaticity of postural control as an essential characteristic of the central reorganization process in persons with lower limb amputation. The role of dual-task procedures as a useful approach to skill assessment is discussed.

> In all cases of lower limb amputation, the body must adapt to a severe asymmetry of mass and muscle power; it must also reform its internal represenJlation or body scheme and learn to bear weight on the artificial jimb to reduce asynmietric loading and lateral instability.

> From a cognitive viewpoint, the restoration of motor control is regarded as a learning process requiring substantial central information processing.**' Because the processing demand is directly related to the novelty and difficulty of the motor task, the lack of task automaticity is indicated by the induced attentional load. In most cognitive theories the available processing resources are assumed to be limited. As a result, resource competition may occur during the performance of more than one attention-demanding task, leading to task interference.'"-

> The relearning of balance control after a lower limb amputation may well depend on central information processing. Accordingly, the central reorganization should be accompanied by a decrease in interference of a concurrent cognitive task with a primary balance task.

> The modified Stroop test was projected onto the screen at eye level with a size of approximately 70cm (width) x 35 cm (height). It consisted of a presentation of 25 colored words (five lines of five words, word size approximately 8cm x 3cm), representing color names that were always incongruent with the printed colors. For instance, the word "BLUE" was printed in the color red. In every sample, the same four colors for words and inks were used—yellow, red, blue, and green. The subjects were instructed to name the colors of the inks, as quickly as possible, from left to right and from the top downward until the end of the test procedure (30th second). At the same time, they had to suppress the strong tendency to read the words.

> With three individuals in the amputation group, who could not perceive all colors of the Stroop test well enough, an arithmetic task was used as the concurrent task. The were instructed to subtract, as quickly as possible, the number 3 from an arbitrary starting number between 50 and 100, which was given to them verbally after the 15th second

> As for the results on the concurrent task, there was no significant differences in the single- or dual-task performance among the three groups of data, nor between the single- and dual-task performance within any group. Apparently, the cognitive task was performed rather consistently, which made it possible to estimate interference effects on the basis of the balance results alone.

> It was shown that a complex dual-task condition provides different information compared to a simple single-task condition. In comparison with control subjects, persons with lower limb amputation showed a lower level of postural efficiency and interference effects caused by a concurrent attention-demanding task

> In this experiment, only the dual-task performance clearly improved in time. Thesefindingssuggest that it is not the motor output as a separate entity, but the motor behavior as the integrative outcome of perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that gradually became more efficient.

> Hence, the general conclusion is drawn that the diminution of interference in the dual-task condition is related to the central sensorimotor reorganization. Unfortunately, a precise explanation of the neural mechanisms underlying the observed task interference is more difficult to give

> However, performing the Stroop test also requires the processing of visual information. Because vision is involved in postural control," and because persons with lower limb amputation suffer from an increased dependency on visual information,'* it cannot be denied that interference of a more specific nature may have played an additional role.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Therefore, part of the interference effects may be due to competitive factors within the uptake or processing of visual information needed to perform the Stroop test and the balance task simultaneously. Consequently, the diminution of interference may partly reflect a decrease of visual dependency during the rehabilitation process in the amputation group.^" Indeed, a lessening dependency on vision for postural control can be seen as an integral part of the central reorganization process after a lower limb amputation.
