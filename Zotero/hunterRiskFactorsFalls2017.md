> Objective: To review the evidence connecting risk factors to falls in adults with a lower limb amputation (LLA) across the continuum of care settings. Design: Systematic review. Literature Survey: Electronic database searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Pubmed, CINAHL, and EMBASE covering January 1988 to January 2016. Noninterventional studies, including cohort and cross-sectional studies, were included. Two reviewers independently completed data extraction and quality evaluation.
Methodology: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and quality of reporting was evaluated using the criteria by Tooth et al. Synthesis: The average quality of reporting score was 19.8, scores ranged from 16 to 29. Studies covered the acute hospital stay after the amputation, inpatient rehabilitation, and community living. Falls were a common occurrence, with the cohort studies reporting 20.8% for acute hospital stay to 58% in the community years after the amputation. Injurious falls also were common, with an occurrence ranging from 40% to 60%. Risk factors that increase falls and are shared with the general population of older adults include lower extremity muscle weakness, increasing age, comorbidities, and number of prescription medications. Risk factors for falls that are unique to adults with LLA are dysvascular etiology of the amputation, transtibial level of amputation in the postoperative period and transfemoral level postrehabilitation, and reduced sense of vibration.
Conclusions: Falls in adults with an LLA are common from the time of the amputation to years later living in the community. Risk factors vary across care settings after the amputation, which has implications for safety and fall-prevention strategies. Level of Evidence: III

> The consequences of these falls include limb fracture [3], fear of falling [4], lack of prosthesis use [5], and subsequent social withdrawal [6].

> People with an LLA due to diabetes demonstrate greater postural instability compared with people whose LLA was the result of trauma [10]

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Cognitive impairment occurs in 42.5% of diabetics and subsequently is more prevalent in people with amputations [12]. Cognitive impairment is associated with increased risk of falls among older adults in general [13,14],

> The cognitive domains affected in people with LLAs are executive function, attention, and complex motor functioning [12].

> Occurrence of falls among adults with a LLA is comparable with or greater than that experienced by frail older adults living in the community, representing a significant public health concern.

> Dite et al [19] used 3 tests (TUG, FSST, and Turn 180 ) to predict falls risk, but these tests have not been validated beyond unilateral transtibial amputee involvement [28]

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Retrospective cohort studies in which the authors evaluate associations between risk factors and risk of falling are limited by recall bias, specifically an underreporting of fall events [30]. The risk estimates from Pauley et al [22] and Miller et al [1] may therefore underestimate the true effect of each factor that was identified.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> It is recommended that future research use a prospective design to allow the analysis of factors which predict falls to offset the limitations of using retrospective and cross-sectional studies to inform knowledge translation for falls prevention

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> An interesting finding from this review was that the level of amputation had contrasting risk depending on the care setting; increased fall risk for transtibial amputees in the acute care hospital [21] whereas transfemoral for community-living people [1].
