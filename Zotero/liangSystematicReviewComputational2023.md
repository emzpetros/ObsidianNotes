> Abstract
            
              Seventy years ago, Hodgkin and Huxley published the first mathematical model to describe action potential generation, laying the foundation for modern computational neuroscience. Since then, the field has evolved enormously, with studies spanning from basic neuroscience to clinical applications for neuromodulation. Computer models of neuromodulation have evolved in complexity and personalization, advancing clinical practice and novel neurostimulation therapies, such as spinal cord stimulation. Spinal cord stimulation is a therapy widely used to treat chronic pain, with rapidly expanding indications, such as restoring motor function. In general, simulations contributed dramatically to improve lead designs, stimulation configurations, waveform parameters and programming procedures and provided insight into potential mechanisms of action of electrical stimulation. Although the implementation of neural models are relentlessly increasing in number and complexity, it is reasonable to ask whether this observed increase in complexity is necessary for improved accuracy and, ultimately, for clinical efficacy. With this aim, we performed a systematic literature review and a qualitative meta‐synthesis of the evolution of computational models, with a focus on complexity, personalization and the use of medical imaging to capture realistic anatomy. Our review showed that increased model complexity and personalization improved both mechanistic and translational studies. More specifically, the use of medical imaging enabled the development of patient‐specific models that can help to transform clinical practice in spinal cord stimulation. Finally, we combined our results to provide clear guidelines for standardization and expansion of computational models for spinal cord stimulation.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> This technology, known as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), is now the most widely adopted neurostimulation therapy, and computer simulations of SCS have paved the way for the use of computational tools in other neurostimulation technologies, such as nerve and deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies (Capogrosso & Lempka, 2020).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Spinal cord stimulation is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for treating refractory pain, with >50,000 implants per year (Sdrulla et al., 2018). SCS for pain management dates back to 1967

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> gate-control theory of pain (Melzack & Wall, 1965), in which Melzack and Wall theorized that the activation of cutaneous fibres can interfere with nociceptive signalling through inhibitory interneurons that ‘gate’ pain transmission from the spinal cord to the brain. This hypothesis led to the suggestion that electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns, which carry low-threshold cutaneous afferents, would drive activity in spinal inhibitory interneurons, which would, in turn, attenuate nociceptive signalling and thereby prevent nociceptive output from the spinal cord to the brain (Lempka & Patil, 2018; Zhang et al., 2014).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> More specifically, three-dimensional (3D) volume conductor models of the spinal cord geometry, which rely on realistic anatomy that can be obtained by anatomical measures and/or medical imaging (Fig. 1A), are used to compute the extracellular potential.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> inally, extracellular potentials are applied to Hodgkin–Huxley neural models (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952) to estimate the corresponding neural response (Fig. 1C).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> With regard to SCS for chronic pain management, computational models have provided insights into which neural pathways primarily respond to SCS, supporting the gate-control mechanism of the therapy (Holsheimer, 2002).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In experiments using SCS to improve locomotion, computational models demonstrated that myelinated afferent fibres are the primary targets of SCS, activating motoneurons and other cells via synaptic pathways (Capogrosso et al., 2013).

<mark style="background-color: #e56eee">Quote</mark>
> antidromic action potentials elicited in primary sensory afferents by SCS interfere with natural sensory feedback, which is crucial for coordinated limb movements (Formento et al., 2018; Moraud et al., 2016; Sadashivaiah et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014). This issue was resolved by implementation of a biomimetic burst stimulation protocol

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Multiple studies have demonstrated that dorsal root fibres are crucial stimulation targets for motor control (Capogrosso et al., 2013; Greiner et al., 2021), which highlights that the inclusion of spinal roots in the FEM model is especially important in SCS for motor control.

> This increase in complexity is attributable both to an increase in the sophistication of components included in the models (e.g. fibre diameters and ion channel dynamics)andtotheintroductionofnewlevelsofdetail (e.g. double-cable myelin model) that provide a more complete or accurate assessment of the neural response (Richardson et al., 2000; Struijk et al., 1992; Wesselink et al., 1999).

> there is a clear trend showing that higher levels of personalization are paralleled by higher levels of complexity in both the FEM and biophysical models (Fig. 5D).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> nterestingly, we found that MRI-based models are used more commonly in the movement application (60% for movement vs. 28% for pain) and have recently expanded to the biophysical application (Fig. 4A).

> These virtual frameworks would successfully meet the need to explore these large parameter spaces efficiently and effectively, which would be infeasible experimentally.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Despite the quasi-uniform assumption, there is a clear trend of increasing complexity over time in both the FEM and biophysical models (Fig. 5A and B).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In contrast, the necessary (and sufficient) complexity to model the axon geometry, and specifically the internode, is more controversial and depends largely on the study.

> The gold standard remains the McIntyre, Richardson and Grill (MRG) model (or derivatives thereof) of the spinal motor axon that was developed two decades ago (Richardson et al., 2000).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Despite the small number of studies using patient-specific models of SCS (i.e. only five papers), their results parallel those of other neurostimulation applications where personalization is more established, namely DBS.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In summary, these studies provide evidence of the great variability in outcome measures deriving from anatomical alterations, suggesting that increased personalization could increase model accuracy by accounting for multiple sources of inter-patient variability. Additionally, these studies suggest that CSF thickness, bone and thecal sac sizes are essential structures for accurate volume conductor models

> Indeed, they reported that a 2 mm displacement from the predicted location caused a drop in selectivity.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, medical imaging has still not been exploited maximally for development of computational models of SCS.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Yet it is now well known that dorsal root diameter, fibre angles and curvature when entering the spinal cord can cause substantial differences in fibre activation threshold (Coburn & Sin, 1985; Struijk et al., 1993). Therefore, accurate images of these structures are pivotal to increase the accuracy of current models.
