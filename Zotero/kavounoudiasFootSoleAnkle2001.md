> 1 In order to assess the relative contribution and the interactions of the plantar cutaneous and muscle proprioceptive feedback in controlling human erect posture, single or combined vibratory stimuli were applied to the forefoot areas and to the tendons of the tibialis anterior muscles of nine standing subjects using various vibration frequency patterns (ranging from 20 to 80 Hz). 2 The variations in the centre of foot pressure, ankle angle and the EMG activities of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles of each subject were recorded and analysed. 3 Separate stimulation of the plantar forefoot zones or the tibialis anterior muscles always resulted in whole-body tilts oppositely directed backwards and forwards, respectively, the amplitude of which was proportional to the vibration frequency. EMG activity of ankle muscles also varied according to the direction of the postural responses. However, the same vibration frequency did not elicit equivalent postural responses: in the low frequency range, tactile stimulation induced stronger postural effects than proprioceptive stimulation, and the converse was the case for the higher frequency range. 4 Under sensory conflict conditions, i.e. foot sole-flexor ankle muscle co-stimulation, the direction of the body tilts also varied according to the difference and the absolute levels of the vibration frequencies. In all cases, the resulting postural shifts always corresponded to the theoretical sum of the isolated effects observed upon vibrating each of these two sensory channels. 5 We proposed that tactile and proprioceptive information from the foot soles and flexor ankle muscles might be co-processed following a vector addition mode to subserve the maintenance of erect stance in a complementary way.

> Because every whole-body tilt simultaneously modifies the plantar pressure distribution under the soles and causes changes in the length of various ankle muscles, we attempted to co-activate the cutaneous and muscular mechanoreceptors in these body zones.

> Two electromagnetic vibrators (Ling Dynamic Systems, type 201) driven by rectangular electrical pulses (5 ms) coupled to power amplifiers were used for the tactile stimulation of the region of the five metatarsal heads of the soles.

> all individual data signals were normalised to the mean initial level recorded during the 500 ms prior to the stimulus. Then they were analysed during the first 3 s of recording, i.e. before the response reached a magnitude at which it was necessary for the experimenter to prevent the subject from falling.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> When vibration was applied to the plantar forefoot zones, the soleus EMG activity first increased while the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior muscle remained at its basal level (Fig. 2A). Then this EMG pattern was reversed: as long as the body was tilting backwards, the EMG activity progressively increased in the tibialis anterior and decreased in the soleus muscles

> stimulating only the tibialis anterior muscles or the plantar forefoot zones resulted in specific EMG activities followed by oriented whole-body tilts, whose direction was always opposite and whose amplitude varied linearly with the vibration frequency

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> As expected from the above data, when the tibialis anterior muscles and the plantar forefoot zones were stimulated simultaneously at the same frequency, the direction of the postural responses depended on the vibration frequency range: on average subjects tilted backwards at 20 or 40 Hz, whereas on average they tilted forwards at 60 and 80 Hz (Fig. 4, 5)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> the results show that the co-activation of proprioceptive and tactile modalities gave rise to specific oriented whole-body tilts whose direction and amplitude clearly depended on both the frequency difference and the absolute levels of vibration frequencies applied. In all cases, the postural responses corresponded to the sum of the effects obtained upon stimulating separately the two sensory modalities.

> functional interpretation currently advanced is that the postural responses of proprioceptive origin might occur to compensate for a virtual body tilt simulated by a vibration whose direction would correspond to the lengthening of the vibrated ankle muscle (Roll et al. 1993; Hlavacka et al. 1996; Massion, 1998; Kavounoudias et al. 1999a)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> the body tilts induced by plantar stimulation can also be interpreted as postural responses compensatory to a virtual body deviation for at least two reasons: (i) the whole-body tilts were always oriented contralaterally with respect to the stimulated plantar zone, (ii) skin mechanoreceptors are very sensitive to mechanical vibration, especially the slowly adaptive receptors, which are able to code every pressure change exerted on their receptive fields (Vedel & Roll, 1982).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Therefore, applying vibration under a delimited plantar area probably simulates a local pressure increase, as when the body is actually tilted in the direction of this area

> low-intensity transcutaneous electrical stimulation (Meyerson, 1983) applied to the foot soles of five standing subjects. Under these conditions, the cutaneous sensation as well as the oriented postural responses induced by the electrical stimulation were similar to those obtained with vibration

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Moreover, whatever the frequency used, the postural responses induced by vibrating the flexor ankle muscles always occurred later than those elicited upon vibrating the forefoot zones of the soles

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> these findings suggest that tactile and proprioceptive afferents from soles and ankle muscles could subserve complementary functions for postural purposes: the regulation of small amplitude body sways would be predominantly assigned to tactile inputs, whereas ankle muscle proprioception would be mainly involved in the regulation of larger body sways
