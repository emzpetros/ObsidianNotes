> Objectives: To assess (1) the effect of task (single and dual task), time (discharge and 4mo), and their interaction for mobility; (2) task prioritization during dual-task testing; and (3) the association between cognition on change in mobility between discharge from rehabilitation and 4 months’ follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Rehabilitation hospital. Participants: People with lower extremity amputations (NZ22) were consecutively recruited at discharge from an inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation program. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Gait velocity and the L Test of Functional Mobility, single and dual task (serial subtractions by 3), were the primary outcomes. Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Trail Making Test quantiﬁed cognition as secondary outcomes. Repeated measures analysis of variance evaluated the effects of task (single task and dual task) and time (at discharge and 4 months’ follow-up) and their interaction on each outcome. A performance-resource operating characteristic graph evaluated gait and cognitive task prioritization. Multivariable linear regression evaluated the association between cognition and change in mobility over time.
Results: No signiﬁcant interactions between task and time were found (all P>.121) for L Test and gait velocity. The L Test single task (PZ.001) and dual task (PZ.004) improved over time. Gait velocity improved over time for both single task and dual task (P<.001). Dual-task performance was slower than single-task performances at each time point. The Trail Making Test B was independently associated with the change in dual-task L Test (PZ.012), and single-task (PZ.003) and dual-task (PZ.006) gait velocity at follow-up.
Conclusions: Gait velocity and L Test single and dual task improved over time. No signiﬁcant interactions indicated that cognitive task did not differentially affect performance over time. Lower executive function scores at discharge were independently associated with lower gains in all gait velocity and dual-task L Test outcomes at follow-up.

> Impairment in cognition affects balance5 and functional mobility6 for people with LLAs using a prosthesis. While a prosthesis may assist with mobility, the process of learning to use a prosthesis can be cognitively challenging.7

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The interrelationship between cognition and gait can be assessed observing people walking while they simultaneously perform another taskdthe dual-task paradigm.8 The difference in performance between single- and dual-task conditions is a measure of an individual’s ability to allocate attentional resources between the 2 simultaneous tasks.8 When attentional resources are overloaded, performance on one or both tasks may deteriorate.9 This is referred to as the dual-task cost.8 Dual-task testing is relevant as many daily activities require the simultaneous performance of 2 or more tasksdoften cognitive and motor tasks in combination.10

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The relationship between cognition and gait is not well understood, though 40.9% of established ambulators with a prosthesis report a need to concentrate on each step they take.14

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> New and established prosthetic ambulators have demonstrated similar performance and task prioritization under dual-task conditions.17 Specifically, both gait and cognitive task performance deteriorate in dual-task testing, but the majority of people prioritized the gait task for a posture-first strategy.17

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Global cognition was measured at admission to rehabilitation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)18 and the Trail Making Test (TMT)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The TMT has 2 parts: Part A assesses visual attention and cognitive speed skills whereas TMT Part B (TMT-B) evaluates higher-order cognitive skills such as working memory and task-shifting or attention, considered a measure of executive functioning.20

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Results are reported as the time required to complete the task to the nearest 100th of a second; a longer completion time indicates greater impairment.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The cognitive task of serial subtractions by 3s, starting at 100, was performed in a seated position prior to the mobility tests. Time to complete 18 subtractions was recorded to the nearest 100th of a second with a stop watch. The responses and number of correct responses given were recorded.21

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> As per standard instruction, participants began from a sitting position, and upon the word “go” rose to standing and walked 3 m, turned 90o, walked 7 m, turned 180o, and walked along the same Lshaped path to return to a seated position.22

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> L Test times were recorded to the nearest 100th of a second with a stop watch and cognitive responses were recorded.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Individuals were given no instructions on task prioritization.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The minimum detectable change (MDC) for the single-task L Test is MDCZ3.19 seconds and for the dual-task L Test is MDCZ3.76 seconds for transtibial amputation of vascular etiology.21

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The MDC of 0.040.06 m/s was used to evaluate velocity scores.23

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> A negative value indicates poorer performance under dual-task conditions (ie, longer walking time under the dual-task condition). A positive value indicates better performance under dual-task conditions (ie, shorter walking time).

> 1 of 4 quadrants: (1) upper left, improvement of gait with worsening of cognitive task; (2) upper right, improvement of gait with improvement of cognitive task; (3) lower left, worsening of gait with worsening of cognitive task; and (4) lower right, worsening of gait with improvement of cognitive task.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> A diagonal line through quadrants 2 and 3 indicates a 1:1 trade-off during dual-task performance; to the left of this line, gait is prioritized and to the right the cognitive task is prioritized.8

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Performance on the dual-task test resulted in a statistically significantly slower gait velocity than the single-task condition at each time point.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> n the L Test, the gait and cognitive tasks were negatively impacted by dual-task testing at both time points. While both tasks deteriorated in the dual-task testing, the trade-off between the tasks indicated the majority of the participants prioritized the gait task over the cognitive task at discharge and 4 months’ follow-up.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> For gait velocity, in contrast to the L Test results, there was a prioritization of the cognitive task over gait performance at discharge and the 4 months’ follow-up. Visually, there was an increase in the prioritization of the cognitive task at 4 months (fig 1, 2).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Importantly, the cognitive task did not appear to differentially affect performance over time

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Understanding the role of cognition in the initial months after the rehabilitation process is important, as, Coffey et al4 found cognitive deficits result in significant difficulties in learning how to use a prosthesis and in regaining mobility and independence in activities of daily living following LLA.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> O’Neill and Evans6 found executive function, using a test of verbal fluency, was associated with less extensive use of the prosthesis 6 months after discharge from rehabilitation.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> We found gait performance was prioritized for the L Test and gait velocity at discharge and remained the salient task for the L Test, a more complex activity, at 4 month

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> This study’s findings are consistent with the posture-first strategy being used at both time points for the more complex task, the L Test, as the gait task was prioritized over the cognitive task.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> In our study, although mobility improved over time, the cognitive demands of ambulating with a prosthesis did not change. Our findings are consistent with the results of Frengopoulos et al17 who found the cognitive demands during walking were similar between new and experienced transtibial amputees using a prosthesis.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Conversely, Geurts et al31 found the cognitive load in static balance positions improved with rehabilitation and suggested this was due to central neural adaptation of the new postural requirements

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Yet, even years after successful completion of prosthetic rehabilitation, 40.9% of people with LLAs report having to concentrate on every step they take when ambulating with their prosthesis.14

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> An exciting area of emerging research in cognitivemotor effects is the role of the prosthesis. Morgan et al33 found a concurrent cognitive task resulted in a similar response to the cognitive demands between age- and sex-matched controls and persons with transfemoral amputations using a prosthesis with a microprocessor knee.
