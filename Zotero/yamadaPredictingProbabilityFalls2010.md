> Background: Falling is a common problem in the growing elderly population. Multitasking or engaging in two or more activities at the same time is common in daily living.
Objective: To determine the usefulness of the trail walking test (TWT) for predicting a fall in community-dwelling elderly individuals.
Methods: A prospective design was employed in this study. One hundred seventy-one community-dwelling elderly individuals (mean age, 80.5 ± 5.6 y) participated in this study. TWT was devised to evaluate the risk of falling. The following tests were performed: TWT, trail making test (TMT), timed up and go test (TUG), functional reach (FR) test, one leg standing (OLS) test, and 10-m walking time test. Test-retest reliability was assessed by repeating TWT within 2 weeks of the first trial, and there was a 1 year follow-up. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to analyze whether TWT, TMT, TUG, FR, OLS, or 10-m walking tests predicted falling.
Results: The test-retest reliability of TWT was high (ICC = 0.945, p < 0.001). After the 1 year follow-up, 59 subjects (34.5%) reported a fall. The stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only TWT was significantly related to falling (odds ratio (OR) 1.160; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.107 - 1.214; p<0.001). In total, 77.8% of cases were correctly classified.
Conclusion: When reliability and validity were considered, the TWT was most useful for assessing the risk of fall.
