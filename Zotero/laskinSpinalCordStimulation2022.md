> Objective: To describe the status of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) research for the improvement of motor, sensory, and autonomic function for individuals living with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Data Sources: This scoping review identiﬁed original research published before March 31, 2021, via literature searches using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Sport Discus, and Web of Science, as well as a targeted search for wellknown principal investigators. Search terms included permutations of “spinal cord stimulation,” “epidural spinal cord stimulation,” “transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation,” “magnetic spinal cord stimulation,” and “neuromodulation.” Study Selection: Studies were included if they (1) were in English, (2) presented original research on humans living with a SCI, and (3) investigated at least 1 of the 3 forms of SCS. Data Extraction: Extracted data included authors, publication year, participant characteristics, purpose, study design, stimulation (device, location, parameters), primary outcomes, and adverse events. Data Synthesis: As a scoping review the extracted data were tabulated and presented descriptively. Themes and gaps in the literature were identiﬁed and reported. Of the 5754 articles screened, 103 articles were included (55 epidural, 36 transcutaneous, 12 magnetic). The primary research design was a case study or series with only a single randomized controlled trial. Motor recovery was the most common primary outcome for epidural and transcutaneous SCS studies, whereas bowel and bladder outcomes were most common for magnetic SCS studies. Seventy percent of the studies included 10 or fewer participants, and 18 articles documented at least 1 adverse event. Incomplete stimulation parameter descriptions were noted across many studies. No articles mentioned direct engagement of consumers or advocacy groups.

> More recently, it was realized that the functions modulated by ESCS could be broadened to motor, sensory, and autonomic functions.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> While ESCS directly stimulates the spinal cord, modeling studies imply that a neuromodulatory mechanism of action for TSCS, magnetic SCS, and to a certain extent ESCS may be as a result of changes in the spinal circuits through the stimulation of afferent fibers in the posterior roots.9

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Possible outcomes addressed by the studies were grouped in the following categories: consumer perspectives, risks and safety, motor recovery (sit to stand, standing, pregait activities), upper extremity function, sensory recovery, ambulation, autonomic effects (ie, sexual function, cardiovascular control, bowel and bladder function), patient-reported outcomes, spasticity, and pain.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Stimulation devices, sites, and parameters varied widely among the studies,

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> A major challenge in the reporting of the stimulation parameters is the inconsistencies of terminology.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Several studies using ESCS and TSCS incorporated concurrent therapy (eg, functional standing activities, gaiting, and functional upper extremity activities) as part of their intervention,

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> None of the articles mentioned the involvement of a consumer (an individual with lived experience) as a part of the research team or any consultation with those living with SCI as to their concerns and/or priorities

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Most studies had cohorts consisting of participants with either a cervical- or thoracic-level SCI, and in general, each study had variation between individuals in terms of the neurologic level of SCI (see fig 5C).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> motor recovery and ambulation were the most frequently reported primary outcome for ESCS (26 of 55 articles),

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Thirteen ESCS, 4 TSCS, and a single magnetic SCS article reported at least 1 adverse event incident during their study

> The term SCS is used throughout this article but with the recognition that this review includes studies both using direct SCS (ESCS) as well as those where the mechanism may be neuromodulation through stimulation of spinal cord posterior root afferents (TSCS and magnetic SCS)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> When looking at the primary outcomes of interest, the focus for ESCS has been overwhelmingly on motor recovery and ambulation (47%), with some attention to bladder function (15%)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> TSCS has also been vested some form of motor recovery (3 of 36 examined upper extremity function) and ambulation (66%) and to a lesser degree on bowel and bladder function, spasticity, and neuropathic pain (20%

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> magnetic SCS has almost solely addressed bowel and bladder function (83%).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Engagement of individuals with lived experience of SCI in the planning stages of research can help ensure SCS study outcomes align with the priorities of the SCI community61; however, none of the articles included in this scoping review mentioned engagement of consumers or advocacy groups to identify treatment and outcome priorities

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> A critical but poorly reported area of interest was risk and safety.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> not one study was designed and conducted to specifically examine risk and safety of TSCS or magnetic SCS for those with SCI, nor was an article found that addressed adverse events associated with research or the use of these devices in the community setting.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Of the 18% of the articles where an adverse event could be identified, 13 of the 18 articles reporting adverse events were using ESCS and often were serious in nature, whereas the adverse events reported for TSCS tended to be more of an inconvenience

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Lastly, there is a need for comparative studies of the 3 forms of SCS.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Recommendations include meaningful engagement of consumers, more robust study designs, larger sample sizes with appropriate representation, comparative SCS studies, improved reporting of the stimulation device and parameters, alignment of study outcomes with the priorities of the community with SCI, and comprehensive reporting of adverse events.
