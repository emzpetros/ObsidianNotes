> The attention demands in balance control after damage to the peripheral sensorimotor system were studied in I2 persons with a recent lower limb amputation. The interference of an arithmetic task with two postural tasks of different complexity (quiet standing and active weight shifting) was examined several times during their rehabilitation while the subjects stood on a force platform. Control data were obtained from healthy subjects. For both postural tasks, persons with amputation performed worse than controls. Quiet standing, a relatively simple task, revealed clear dual-task interferenceonly in the amputation group. Evidence was found for a reduction in dual-taskinterferenceas rehabilitation progressed. In contrast, voluntary (feedback-controlled)weight shifting, a more complex task. revealed an equal amount of dual-task interference in persons with amputation and in controls, without changes in interferenceover the period of rehabilitation.The results indicate that attentional mechanisms may be involved in postural control, depending on both the novelty and complexity of the task. Moreover, a reduction in attention demands of quiet standing may reflect a central adaptation of the postural organization to the peripheral sensorimotor impairments caused by lower limb amputation.

> Instead, in many clinical experiments, basic motor skills such as standing and walking are assessed under single-task and optimal sensory condi- tions, thus excluding the role of higher-order central pro- cesses from the scope of investigation (Mulder & Geurts. 1991; Patla, 199

> Consequently, an important aspect of motor recovery after peripheral lesions may be reflected in a changing interaction between lower-level (automatic) control mechanisms and higher-order (attention-demanding) central processes

> From a cognitive viewpoint (see for a re- view Masson, 1990). it is often presumed that new linkages between sensory input and motor output are formed on the basis of adapted central representations. As a result. the need for attentional mechanisms concerned with error detection and correction lessens, leading to a reduction in task concurrence costs.

> In this perspective, it is interesting to note that the somatosensory cortex maintains a lifelong plasticity as it shows a rapid functionalreorganization following sectioningof peripheral nerves or amputation of a body part (Kaas, Merzenich, & Killackey, 1983)

> the decrease in attention demands in postural control after lower limb amputation does not necessarily imply that the central reorganization following peripheral sensorimotor damage is under direct attentional control. Instead, it may be that a self-organizational capacity within central representations indirectly reduces the need for attentioninvested error detection and correction.
