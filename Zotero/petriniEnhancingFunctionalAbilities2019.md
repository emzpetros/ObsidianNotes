              The lack of sensory feedback from the leg prosthesis in lower limb amputees is associated with risk of falls, low mobility, and perception of the prosthesis as external object. Here, Petrini
              et al.
              tested a leg neuroprosthesis, which provided real-time on-demand tactile sensory feedback through nerve stimulation in three transfemoral amputees. The stimulation improved mobility, decreased falling episodes, and increased the perception of the prosthesis as part of the body. Active complex tasks were accomplished with reduced effort when the nerve stimulation was turned on. The results suggest that real-time nerve stimulation could help restore natural sensation in lower leg amputees.
            
          , 
            Lower limb amputation (LLA) destroys the sensory communication between the brain and the external world during standing and walking. Current prostheses do not restore sensory feedback to amputees, who, relying on very limited haptic information from the stump-socket interaction, are forced to deal with serious issues: the risk of falls, decreased mobility, prosthesis being perceived as an external object (low embodiment), and increased cognitive burden. Poor mobility is one of the causes of eventual device abandonment. Restoring sensory feedback from the missing leg of above-knee (transfemoral) amputees and integrating the sensory feedback into the sensorimotor loop would markedly improve the life of patients. In this study, we developed a leg neuroprosthesis, which provided real-time tactile and emulated proprioceptive feedback to three transfemoral amputees through nerve stimulation. The feedback was exploited in active tasks, which proved that our approach promoted improved mobility, fall prevention, and agility. We also showed increased embodiment of the lower limb prosthesis (LLP), through phantom leg displacement perception and questionnaires, and ease of the cognitive effort during a dual-task paradigm, through electroencephalographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that induced sensory feedback can be integrated at supraspinal levels to restore functional abilities of the missing leg. This work paves the way for further investigations about how the brain interprets different artificial feedback strategies and for the development of fully implantable sensory-enhanced leg neuroprostheses, which could drastically ameliorate life quality in people with disability.

> We found that there is a positive proportional relationship between the amplitude of the injected stimulation current and the intensity of the corresponding evoked sensation (fig. S1, A to C). This is consistent with what was observed in upper limb amputeesimplantedwiththesamenerveinterface(21, 26, 27)andfoundin modeling works (28).

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> readouts of three of these sensors and of the encoder were used to linearly drive the stimulation of neural electrode active sites, that elicited touch (or pressure or vibration) under the foot sole (forefoot, midfoot,andhindfootpositions) and contraction of the gastrocnemius (for S1 and S2), or pressure on the gastrocnemius (for S3), which were intuitively interpreted by subjects as knee flexion (or specific angle positioning and its variation) within physiological range, emulating a proprioceptive feeling (

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> To rule out that recognition of leg touch or movement could be achieved through the stump-socket interaction, the users were connected to the prosthesis and were asked to identify touch or flexion events without stimulation. The performance in each passive task dropped to around chance level (fig. S4, A to F), showing that the participants were unable to accomplish these tasks without neural stimulation (fig. S4, G and H).

> Cutaneous feedback is involved in the correct positioning of the foot during normal locomotion or after perturbations induced by mechanical obstruction (37)

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> We hypothesize that the awareness triggered by the different feedback evoked when stepping on an obstacle with respect to steps without obstacles prompts the user to stabilize the walking (for example, by abruptly transferring the weight with consequent stop of the prosthetic knee or making an extra stabilizing step). In other words, the subjects manage to use this information to drastically reduce the falls

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The combination of muscle contraction and prosthesis motion was perceived by the subjects as knee angle position variation. In other words, a specific value of injected charge produced a specific muscle contraction that was interpreted by the subjects as knee-specific position, whereas a change of the charge injected produced a change of the muscle contraction, thus a change of specific knee position, which was interpreted as motion of the knee

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The subjects did not need any training to associate the muscle contraction with the flexion/extension of the knee. We just explained the neuroprosthesis functioning to the subjects the first time they used it.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> The protocol proposed by Zink et al. (33)andPolichet al. (34) was reproduced. A standard sound (900 Hz) and two deviant tones (attended or target and non-attended or deviant tones at 600 and 1200 Hz), lasting 80 ms, were delivered to the participants in a random order through commercial headphones. The participants were told that the target tone was either 600 or 1200 Hz.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The hypothesis (33) was that if more cognitive power was consumed to pay attention to walking, then less attention would have been used for counting the tones with consequently low P300 amplitude recorded.
