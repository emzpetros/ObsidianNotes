> Objective: To review the influence of physical capacity on regaining walking ability and the development of walking ability after lower limb amputation. Design: A systematic search of literature was performed. The quality of all relevant studies was evaluated according to a checklist for statistical review of general papers. Subjects: Lower limb amputees. Main measures: Physical capacity (expressed by aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, muscle force, flexibility and balance) and walking ability (expressed by the walking velocity and symmetry).
Results: A total of 48 studies that complied with the inclusion criteria were selected. From these studies there is strong evidence for deterioration of two aspects of physical capacity (muscle strength and balance) and of two aspects of walking ability (walking velocity and symmetry) after lower limb amputation. Strong evidence was found for a relation between balance and walking ability.
Conclusion: Strong evidence was only found for a relation between balance and walking ability. Evidence about a relation between other elements of physical capacity and walking ability was insufficient. Training of physical capacity as well as walking ability during rehabilitation following lower limb amputation should not be discouraged since several parameters have been shown to be reduced after amputation, although their relation to regaining walking ability and to the development of walking ability remains unclear.

> physical capacity is the ability to perform activities of daily living and leisure, determined by the capacities of the physiological system and the neuromuscular system (adapted from Moore et al.9). Physical capacity can be expressed by the following outcome measures: aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, muscle force, flexibility and balance and can be influenced through practice and training.9

> Endurance training, by performing one-leg cycling,17 was shown to increase the physical fitness of traumatic amputees to the level of ablebodied subjects.13 The anaerobic threshold and the maximum oxygen uptake of traumatic amputees both increased significantly after endurance training.18

> The development of walking ability is strongly related to balance, because the studies of Matjacic and Burger41 and Schoppen et al.43 were prospective (Table 4c). Regaining walking ability could be influenced by the amount of balance.43
