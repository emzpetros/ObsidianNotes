> Cognitive–motor interference refers to the phenomenon in which carrying-out simultaneously a cognitive and a motor task interferes with the performance of one or both tasks.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> he overload of attentional resources during DT may disrupt both cognitive performance and gait in individuals with slower walking speed (WS) [4] and higher gait variability [5].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Furthermore, higher gait variability has been related to increased fall risk [6]

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> In particular, very slow WS might require greater attention, due to reduced automaticity and higher cortical demands with increased interference during DT [9,10]

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Walking on a treadmill was carried out in the single task condition at 100%, 60% and 20% of their spontaneous walking speed (WS), previously calculated for each participant during 10 min walking on the treadmill.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The DT conditions consisted of walking at the same three velocities while backward counting by three, starting from 300.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> The participants were asked not to prioritize either task over the other

> stride time (ST), coefficient of variation of stride time (CoV) and double support percentage (DS) of stride cycle

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Higher DT cost on the cognitive task was found at spontaneous and very slow walking speed, while at slow walking speed the cognitive task was prioritized with higher DT cost on the motor task.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Dual task cost on both gait and cognitive parameters was also calculated using the formula [(Single-task–Dualtask)/Single-task*100] [11].

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> However, DT cost on CoV parameter was significantly (Bonferroni correction P < 0.05/3 = 0.017) higher at 60% WS than 100% WS (Z = 2.46, P = 0.014).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> statistical analysis of cognitive performance showed significant (Bonferroni correction P < 0.05/6 = 0.008) differences between single task and DT at 100% WS (Z = 3.06, P = 0.002), single task and DT at 20% WS (Z = 3.62, P = 0.0002), and DT at 20% and 60% WS (Z = 2.91, P = 0.003).

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> To summarize, participants showed better cognitive task performance during single task and DT at 60% WS than during DT at 100% and 20% WS.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> During walking at spontaneous or very slow WS, attentional resources are preferentially allocated to the motor task as indexed by higher DT cost on the cognitive performance. This strategy may be explained by gait prioritization during challenging motor conditions

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> walking at slow speed, does not interfere with the cognitive task but rather increases DT cost on gait variability. This finding, suggesting an attentional shift from an easier motor task to the cognitive processing, might mirror the spontaneous strategy to decrease WS when carrying out a cognitive task during gait to reduce the attentional resources to the motor component and facilitate cognition.

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Findings of our study are consistent with a previous work [11] showing reduced DT cognitive cost (on a Stroop Task) at slower than spontaneous WS.
