> Background: 3D Virtual Reality (VR) offers new opportunities in vestibular science. It also presents new challenges and problems. Aims/objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effective factors in the 3D VR Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) test and the impact of cybersickness on the test results. Material and methods: The effect of the foam surface, head position in the yaw axis, moving background, and arm position holding the controller was tested. Cybersickness was evaluated using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ).
Results: The head position and controller holding style significantly affected the results. The foam surface and the moving background did not have a significant effect. Although 61.4% of the patients fell into the bad category according to the symptoms of the SSQ score, cybersickness did not significantly affect the SVV results.
Conclusions and significance: In 3D VR SVV, additional factors should be considered: the headset’s weight, head position, and how we hold the controller. The A-effect emerged when the head was 45 degrees turned on the yaw axis. A significant shift was detected in the test, with the arm holding the controller at 90 degrees. Most subjects felt cybersickness at a considerable level. Cybersickness should always be taken into account in VR when planning new applications.

> Perceiving the gravity vector correctly is one of the important factors in maintaining our balance. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) primarily evaluates the function of the saccule and central graviceptive pathways.

> The participant adjusts the bar vertically using the left/ right arrow signs on the controller. When verticality is confirmed by pressing the central button on the control unit, the computer records the bar’s angle and the head’s position. Each test was repeated three times at 5-s intervals. After the angles three times, the average value was recorded

> SVV tests were carried out while sitting, standing on a firm and foam surface, head turned 45 degrees to the right and left on the yaw axis, the arm holding the controller at 90 degrees and 180 degrees (angle of the elbow), standing on a firm and foam surface with moving visual background (Figure 2).

> In our study, we observed that the dynamic background increased the deviation of the SVV, and the variability increased more when a soft surface was added. However, no statistically significant differences were observed whether the test was performed on a firm or foam surfac
