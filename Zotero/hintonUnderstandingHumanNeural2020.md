> Many studies of split-belt treadmill adaptation have been focused on the biomechanical changes that occur in response to walking on belts at diﬀerent speeds. This process of adaptation, and the ensuing aftereﬀects that are present when participants return to typical treadmill walking, have inspired the potential use of the splitbelt treadmill as a rehabilitation tool. However, a full systematic review of the current split-belt treadmill literature has not yet been published to consolidate what is known about how the human central nervous system (CNS) controls adaptation to this type of symmetry perturbation. A systematic literature search identiﬁed 55 studies that investigated the neural control of human gait adaptation to a split-belt treadmill. Studies of infants and manipulated sensory feedback in healthy adults suggest that the initial gait adjustments to split-belt walking are reliant on proprioceptive feedback to inform central pattern generators to modify lower limb muscle activation patterns appropriately. Simultaneously, this literature suggested that proprioceptive and visual feedback inform supraspinal centres for motor planning and motor output to adapt and store a new and eﬃcient gait pattern to walk on belts at diﬀerent speeds. However, evidence from participants with brain injury (post-stroke, cerebellar lesions) suggest that injury impedes, but does not completely take away, the ability to adjust and adapt aspects of the gait pattern to split-belts. The model proposed from this review provides the overarching roles of the CNS in the adaptation process, speciﬁcally in short-term, and potential sites of focus within the human CNS for future rehabilitation-based work.

> On a daily basis, we adjust our symmetrical straight ahead walking pattern to be asymmetrical, using diﬀerent step lengths to steer the body in a new direction.

> Kinetically, ground reaction forces and lower limb muscle activity decrease over the course of adaptation to similar levels of typical steady-state gait

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Simultaneously, interlimb aspects of the gait cycle, such as gait phasing and step length, shift from asymmetric toward symmetry, improving metabolic eﬃciency

> The primary hypothesized region for split-belt adaptation has been the cerebellum as a site for sensory prediction error and feedback driven updates to the locomotor plan (Bastian, 2006; Choi et al., 2009; Malone and Bastian, 2010; Malone et al., 2012) or that each leg is controlled by its own peripheral proprioceptive receptors and spinal circuits (Dietz et al., 1994; Jensen et al., 1998; Prokop et al., 1995). Since the motor cortex is concerned with precise movements and limb control during locomotion, primary sensorimotor and association areas would likely aid in implementing anticipatory gait pattern changes (Choi et al., 2015; Reisman et al., 2010a).

> Role of Sensory Feedback: The role of sensory feedback during split-belt adaptation was assessed using paradigms that altered body weight, visual, optic ﬂow or movement feedback, vestibular or muscle stimulation, or with plantar vibration (Table 5). Sensory feedback manipulations in healthy adults allowed for observations and hypotheses to be made on the role of diﬀerent types of sensory feedback

> cutaneous nerve stimulation in healthy participants (Table 5, reference 43) suppresses TA reﬂex responses during early to mid-stance of SB treadmill walking, suggesting that proprioceptive information is downregulated to avoid inadvertent muscle activations during this critical phase of the adaptation process

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> In contrast, all other manipulations to other sources of sensory feedback (i.e. altered visual feedback, vestibular stimulation, plantar vibration or movement feedback) in healthy participants did not aﬀect the initial gait adjustments to split-belt treadmill walking (Table 5, references 42, 44–55).

> First, the CNS is incorporating belt speed changes as adjustments to the gait pattern, using primarily proprioceptive feedback to inform spinal circuits of the required gait cycle changes. At the same time, but likely separately, areas of the cortex (motor planning and sensory integration areas) and cerebellum are incorporating this sensory feedback information in a feed-forward manner to make anticipatory changes to the gait pattern.

> the CNS can not only create a biomechanically and metabolically eﬃcient gait pattern on split-belts, but also store this gait pattern on a short-term basis
