- Figure of eight walk test instead of L-test or TUG
	- Testing it's use with LLA
- Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility PLUSM + Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale ABC
- Amputee Mobility Predictor AMP, ten meter walk test, six minute walk test
- Carrying tray with two cups
- Uneven, soft terrain made of mats
- Differences between novel conditions and normal walking F8W
- Condition 2 - tray only had difs betwixts TT and TF


[[schackIncreasedPrefrontalCortical2022]]
- Filling gap of PFC activation examination during challenging walking conditions: LLA and controls
- Direct and indirect pathways of locomotor controls 
- Varying results on PFC activation, may be due to environment and task type
To our knowledge, only a limited number of dual-task studies in persons with LLA exists (Frengopoulos et al., 2018a;Hunteretal.,2018; Lamoth, Ainsworth, Polomski, and Houdijk, 2010; Morgan, Hafner, and Kelly, 2016, 2017;Pruzineretal., 2019)

- MoCA and TMT
- Amputee Mobility Predictor AMP, Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility PLUS-M
- F8W with self-selected speed, WCT carrying tray, WUT uneven terrain 
- fNIR processing: HR as regressor for filtering 
	- https://www.nitrc.org/projects/fnirs_downstate/
- Largest changes in dorsolateral prefrontal area potentially related to processing of sensory information 
	- More attention needed here due to lack of sensory input
- 

[[cieslakAssociationChangesSubjective2020]]
- Subj and obj measures don't always agree
- L-test + Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire PEQ utilized 
- Serial subtraction for DT by threes

[[hunterDeterminingReliabilityDualTask2018]]
- TT vascular and non, TF or bilateral
- L-test
- MoCA, ABC
- Serial-subtraction by threes- mental tracking
- No prioritization
- Only times recorded: no cognitive accuracy, no walking speed or gait params 

[[hunterCognitionPredictsMobility2019]]
- Rehab effects on DT
- Faster gait speed for ST and DT
- Serial subtraction by 3 during L-test and while walking on GAITRite
- DT always slower than ST
- CT did not affect performance differently over time
- L-test **gait performance prioritized** initially + follow up 
- Gait velocity prioritized **cognitive** initially, and even more strongly at follow up 
- L-test considered the more complex assessment 
- Executive functioning, attention, complex motor functioning [[coffeyCognitiveFunctioningPersons2012]]

[[coffeyCognitiveFunctioningPersons2012]]
- Areas affected in LLA

[[hunterRiskFactorsFalls2017]]
- On par with older adults
- Lower extremity muscle weakness, age, comorbidities, prescription meds
- Unique to LLA: dysvascular etiology, TT amputation in acute care, TF post rehab , reduced vibration 
	- More time in wheelchair in hospital, less fall chance
- TUG, FSST, Turn 180 not validated beyond unilateral
- L-test not tested for predictiveness of falls
- Have not quantified... vision, sensation, cognition, status of nonoperative leg (pain, sensation, strength etc.)




[[mollerCorticalBrainActivity2020]]
- ST straight overground walking
- Condition 2: while sorting for a colored + numbered key with one hand
- Condition 3: Trail-walking test TWT - 15 flags [[yamadaPredictingProbabilityFalls2010]]
- Higher oxyHb for DT walk compared with ST walking for MPK
	- TWT higher than KEY
- no differences with non-MPK groups between ST and DT walking
	- Could have reached max cortical effort in ST
- Secondary task not accurately evaluated but qualitatively no differences 
- Both LLA groups had higher oxyHb compared to controls 
	- **More attention** at baseline!
- Limitations
	- All secondary tasks were motor + cognitive 
	- Walking condition order not random



[[frengopoulosDualtaskGaitAssessmenta]]
- ```Stride velocity is inversely related to stride variability; a decrease in velocity causes an increase in stride variability (Dubost et al., 2006; Heiderscheit, 2000).```
- "Cross-talk model" + "peripheral overload" similarity in tasks may lead to performance improvements 
- mental tracking, verbal fluency disturb gait more - Al-Yahya, 2011
- Gait speed as a differentiator 
- Current lit: Morgan, Hafner, Kelley, 2016 and Lamoth, Ainsworth, Polomski 2010
- Serial subtraction by 3's + L-test
- Four square step test for balance assessment 
- ABC scale
- Trail making test TMT for executive fxn
- One individual did straight walking faster at follow up under DT
- Did see much gait variability changes betwixt ST and DT for either cognitive group
	- Need for comparison with controls without lower limb amputations 
- Supporting a posture ***second*** strategy with consistent gait decreases 

[[petriniEnhancingFunctionalAbilities2019]]
- Cognitive task was tone identification "oddball" task, pick out the wrong one
- EEG readings
	- P300 ERP expected to be higher for target tones
	- "The hypothesis (33) was that if more cognitive power was consumed to pay attention to walking, then less attention would have been used for counting the tones with consequently low P300 amplitude recorded."


[[chandrasekaranSensoryRestorationEpidural2020]]
- Stim results
	- Presence of contralateral percepts + residual limb feeling seem to be an issue
	- Removal in one participant due to discomfort
	- Large subject variability in naturalness, freq dependence, locations
	- Diffuse percepts 
	- Dermatomal deviations 
- SCS method drawbacks: lead migration 15-20%

[[laskinSpinalCordStimulation2022]]
- Primarily motor control, sensory not even mentioned
- Adverse events present, not well documented 


[[wahnCanLimitationsVisuospatial2017]]
- Are there separate attentional resource pools for different sensory modalities or are they shared
- Seems to depend on the type of attentional processing: spatial or object based
- Redundant sensory information as method to reduce cognitive load -> multisensory integration (see paper for more)

[[mirmoezziStabilityWalkingAffected2019]]
- Walking at non preferred worsened cognitive load
- Metric to combine accuracy and speed 

# To Look Into
- Direct and indirect locomotor pathways
- Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
	- Sensory input, is it somatosensory??
- Spinal stim

# To Find
- Measuring cardiopulmonary parameters during dual-task while walking
# Areas
- Older adults
- Younger adults
- Effect of gait speed + task
