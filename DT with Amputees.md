Dual-task standing and walking in people with lower limb amputation: A structured review
- Motivation
	- "concentrate on every step"
	- Correlated with fear of falling
- Methods
	- Self selected overground or treadmill
	- "measures of pace (i.e. walking speed9,31 and stride time9,31), asymmetry (i.e. percent time spent in stance phase and double-contact29 and step time asymmetry31), and postural stability (i.e. step or stride width,29,31 stride time coefficient of variation,9 margin of stability,29 mediolateral and anteriorâ€“posterior trunk acceleration,9 local stability exponent,9 and sample entropy9)."
- Results
	- Does NOT support higher cognitive demand during walking for LLA compared to controls 
	- Need for self-report + performance-based data
- Discussion 
	- Need to assess dual-task walking in challenging / unpredictable conditions that reflect real life environments
	- Flat ground walking may not be complex enough 
	- More sensitive outcome measures, fNIRS, psychophysiological measures

	- Challenges for LLA: postural stability, energy expenditure, speed, gait asymmetries

Variability and stability analysis of transfemoral amputees

The effects of a concurrent task on walking in persons with transfemoral amputation compared to persons without limb loss
- Results
	- LLA walked "worse" than able bodied
	- No effect on walking speed - slight increase
	- Both groups had longer response times with DT
	- Self-reported higher difficulty 
	- Limitation that individuals had a high level of physical capability
