    - [ ] Make figur 4 horizontal
- [ ] Dual-task
- [ ] Results:

- mention it in titles too
- add stats to plot
- outcome measures and results change title or add it before
- correct figure caption for diagram
- tried to be consistent

Could quantify own reaction time

- would be an order of mag less than measured, could be noise

Define rn time as stimuli presention and recording of experimenter for the result

Make results heading bigger

- reaction time description in word

Figure 5 participant with transtibial limb loss

- with SNP active and inactive

Add abbreviations to the cognitive figure

Make plots lather

Consolidate conclusion and future work yet

Box plots for gait: point out number

- don't point out number, add resolution on gait speed y axis
- making a point about group did
- change colors

Keep same grouping

Box plots

Curious about LE06

Effect sizes: change scores

Including baseline : change from baseline

Add signifcane bars

May be speeding though an uncomfortable situation

Very interesting that he's speeding

Cognitive performance numbers as well eventually

Margin of stability

Collect input from the field

Conclusion

- go into interpretation and implications
- largest reaction time for ic suggestion

SNP resoluted in faster speed

. At end of each sentence

  

  

  

Talking Points

- Intro
    - Somatosensory sensation plays an important role in walking
    - Individuals with lower limb amputations have this sensation severely limited
    - Restoring this sensation via a neural interface has seen benefits
    - In addition to direct sensory inputs, gait also relies on higher level cognitive processes (obstacle crossing + navigation)
    - Dual-task paradigms are on method to probe this attention split
    - Lower limb amputees have demonstrated cognitive motor interference
    - What is the effect of restoring plantar sensation?
- To answer this question I utilized my lab’s SNP system
    - components
    - Elicited sensations from missing limb
- This system will be used in a dual task paradigm
    - Single task trials and then several dual task trials
- Motor task
    - Self-paced walking
    - Algo: keeps participant centered in the anterior posterior direction
- CWM: variation on stroop
- Experimental setup: safety harness, SNP system on their normal prosthesis
- Results Rxn Time
    - Did not seem to be affected by SNP but IC did appear to have higher times
    - Pointing to it being difficult
- Results Gait speed
    - Interesting result here was faster gait speeds for harder difficulties: trying to get it over with, may be walking faster to keep up with mental processing (rate of answers is actually slower)
- Future work will be to continue this data collection and examine the gait parameters in more detail
    - I’m also interested in other dual task paradigms

  

Poster Feedback: A0 841mm X 1189mm

- [x] jn intro say something about cognitive load & amputees. If we have sth to back up our claim (increased cognitive load during ambulation, worse cognitive performance during walking etc) or we don’t know yet (it is yet to be determined how cognitive load affects walking). Also take advantage of what Stani et al have published on cognitive load. Most likely if he is there, he will come to your poster and he will directly say: oh! we have done this 3 years ago! what is new!!? we have to be ready to respond to him
- [x] You may need to add a little bit more on neural interface, remember not everyone knows about it. You still have some space and acknowledgement can have much smaller font
- [x] maybe have a little diagram for defining what reaction time is
- [x] All SNP conditions should be Active vs Inactive as opposed to On vs Off (update plots and language)
- [x] In plots, can you show error bar only in one direction (up)
- [ ] Figure 7, do you have any stats?
- [ ] I don’t understand if the plots show data pooled across all subjects? do you see any differences between how subjects performed? like they all followed the same trend?
- [ ] We need to work on Figure 8. (you say gait speed was faster, but I don’t believe it. Is that statistically different for IC? really? even if statistically different, does that practically matter? like 0.01 m/s difference?

- [ ] do we have any other outcome measures to report on?
- [x] Too many references, keep to 3, and use short style referencing, like Nature or sth
