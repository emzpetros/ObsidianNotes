Can it correlate with fall risk?

associated with elevated cognitive processing in motor planning

Notes

Such knowledge would enable rehabilitation to more effectively target functional outcomes.

Gait rehab would have a complete understanding of how sensory information is processed in motor planning and cortical processes to utilize them to improve function outcomes.

Peripherial stim interventation

Plantar sensation affects motor learning + adaptation + speed perception, affecting porprio + limb movement: suggesting higher circuitries are involved

Amputees serve as a model : sensory feedback to motor learning

Understanding how peripherial goes to CNS, develop intervention + paradigms

Understand the mech of action -> motor learning, can develop tools after that

- New skill, sports

Motor learning + adaptation

Amputees are a perfect model, intact CNS , otherwise healthy , no cerebellum disfunction

Cognitive loading as well, CNS affected : motor, cognitive processing

Plantar sensation affects balance and gait [CITE] and becomes compromised with age, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis amputation,  
but the mechanism of how this sensory information from the foot and ankle is integrated into the central nervous system (CNS) and how neural circuitries are involved in locomotion is not well understood. Previous work has demonstrated that plantar sensation impacts motor learning and adaptation [CITE].  
Understanding the relationship between peripheral sensation and CNS processing could provide insights that guide rehabilitation interventions for those with lower limb sensorimotor impairments.

Plantar sensation has an established role in spinal reflexes but has also been associated with cortical processing. However, the integration of this peripheral information into high level circuitries is not well understood. Plantar sensation has been shown to affect motor adaptation and speed perception which

Such knowledge would enable rehabilitation to more effectively target functional outcomes.  
This intervention would be most effective with complete knowledge of how sensory information impacts high level cortical processes involved with motor planning for example with gait and navigation.

Characterize the effects of plantar sensation on brain activity and locomotion circuitry.

Determine the role of plantar sensation in activities that require motor planning by developing a VR/AR platform for walking in simulated environments with crowds or obstacles.

To investigate how plantar sensation is processed in the CNS, we will measure cortical activation during dual-task (DT) experiments. DT paradigms involve concurrently performing a motor and cognitive task which stresses the cognitive processes of executive function and divided attention. These scenarios are of functional relevance for activities of daily living where multitasking can cause cognitive loading.

Rehabilitation through physical therapy aims to improve functional outcomes for these individuals to improve mobility and quality of life. However, these interventions operate

Currently, rehabilitation interventions for these individuals operate without a complete understanding of how this plantar sensation is integrated into the central nervous system (CNS) and contributing to cortical level processes such as motor planning.

To assess plantar sensation’s effects in a real-word scenario, I intend to develop a crowd-walking task where the user is presented with virtual avatars as obstacles. Building this scenario in VR allows for an immersive and complex environment that realistically taxes motor planning while remaining safe.

  

  

. Previous work has demonstrated a link between plantar sensation and gait and balance [Ellis], but it does not illuminate how the peripheral information affects higher neural circuitries.

  

have noted an increased cognitive load while walking preventing day-to-day multitasking and impeding balance confidence [Manz].

  

- Clarify about not restoring sensation, understanding what role it plays
- Clarify how knowing the cortical aspect will improve fall outcomes, introduce cognitive loading earlier
- more stats on falls
- Could add negative reactions to anesthetics
- Critical impact is falling less + improving performance
- Add # participants , prelim results
