Three people who made change happen

- My mom, James, Zack

When you made something happen describe it, help did it make you feel

- Started a crowdfunding campaign for my club humanitarian design corps
- Put together a video, website descriptions, pictures, testimonials
- Reached out to CAA
- $5k
- Ver accomplished and excited for the future of the club

Experienced change, respond positively or negatively

- Online classes, relatively positively
- Nice to spend time at home and save time walking around campus
- Lots of video games

Lessons learned from making change happen

- Make a plan but be prepared for it to change
- If you want it done right do it yourself
- Reach out to people who know how to do things already
