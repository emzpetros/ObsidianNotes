## Abstract

**Advisor:** Dr. Hamid Charkhkar 
**Title:** Under (Plantar) Pressure: Effect of a Sensory Neuroprosthesis on Gait under Cognitive Load
**Abstract:** There are more than a million people living with lower limb loss in the United States alone.  After amputation, these individuals rely on a prosthesis for ambulation but this device does not convey plantar sensation to the user.  Because of this absence, this population faces a higher cognitive load during ambulation.  This challenge spills into other deficits of gait such as lower balance confidence and reduced mobility.  Our team has developed a sensory neuroprosthesis (SNP) that utilizes high density nerve cuff electrodes to elicit plantar sensation in our participant's missing limb.  I have investigated how this intervention affects cognitive loading during walking with a dual-task experiment.  Participants walked with and without sensory stimulation on a self-paced treadmill while performing a variant of the Stroop task.  Metrics for both tasks were analyzed including reaction time, accuracy, and gait speed.  Increasing cognitive load resulted in longer reaction times across the board and higher gait speeds in two out of three participants.  I will discuss how these results suggest participants engage with a strategy of automatic walking in dual-task conditions and how plantar sensation could be modulating this shift.  Such an interaction would shed light on how peripheral input impacts processes in the central nervous system.

**Title: Direct Comparison of Perceived Tactile Sensations Evoked by Intracortical Microstimulation, Peripheral Nerve Stimulation, and Mechanical Indentation**

Both intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) can restore tactile sensation to people living with physical disabilities, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) or amputation. However, the relative benefits and limitations of these stimulation approaches are unclear since they have only been examined previously in separate studies with separate subjects. In this study, we directly compared the perceived sensations evoked by ICMS and PNS in the same person for the first time and compared each stimulation approach to natural touch.

This study was conducted with a participant with sensory-incomplete high-cervical SCI (AIS-B C3/C4) who was enrolled in the Reconnecting the Hand and Arm to the Brain (ReHAB) clinical trial. We delivered natural touch stimuli with a computer-controlled tactor positioned over the fingertips. PNS was delivered to individual contacts in a multi-contact composite flat interface nerve electrodes (C-FINE) around the median or ulnar nerve. ICMS was delivered to individual electrodes in two 64-channel recording and stimulating arrays in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The perceived intensity, naturalness, location, and quality descriptors were recorded using psychophysical methods while stimulation magnitude varied over one of three levels (30%, 60%, 90% of sensory dynamic range) for each of the stimulation modalities (tactor, PNS, ICMS).

We found that the perceived intensity significantly increased with stimulation magnitude and perceived naturalness significantly decreased with stimulation magnitude for all modalities and locations tested (linear regression, p<0.001). There was also a significant negative relationship between perceived intensity and naturalness for all modalities and locations tested (linear regression, p<0.001). However, on average, the perceived intensity of PNS was significantly higher than that of ICMS or tactor (Tukey HSD, p<0.05). The perceived naturalness was also separable by stimulation modality (Tukey HSD, p<0.001); the naturalness was highest for tactor, medium-high for ICMS, and lowest for PNS. The inverse was true for perceived location (Tukey HSD, p<0.001); the area was largest for PNS, medium for ICMS, and smallest for tactor. The perceived quality of the sensation was more similar for ICMS and tactor stimuli than for PNS and tactor stimuli.

This study provides the opportunity to understand the benefits of each stimulation approach in modulating evoked sensation. These insights will guide the development of future sensory restoration approaches to best meet patient needs and improve rehabilitation efforts for people with a variety of somatosensory deficients.

  

  

Electrical stim at different points in pathway: spinal, cortical, PNS

Sensation description : location, intensity, timing, quality

- flesher 2016, Hughes 2021

Hypothesis: PNS closer to tact or than ICMS

Catch trial of no stim

Sensory dynamic range: threshold to max comfortable

All modalities are distinct , variable inter trial delay

- done with combo of overlapping and distinct locations

May be worth looking at SD

Less natural as magnitude increases, ICMS actually more natural than PNS

- related to h is description of natural as a soft touch
- Could be related to SCI impairing info flow to cortex
- Cortex integrates info at higher level than PNS
- Recruitment of nerve fibers under electrical is not he same as natural
- The cortex has more of a mixed response, RA and SA combined , stim may be more amenable to this type of stim

hairy vs glaberous skin

  

Train is already known to be non natural

Can stimulate very simply in cortex and get natural feeling

  

RT time analysis??

  

Sensation doesn’t have to be natural to be useful

**Title: Algorithmic Optimization of Extraneural Electrodes for Stimulation Selectivity**

**Abstract:** Neuromodulation in peripheral nerves is a powerful technique for addressing many different conditions. Peripheral neuromodulation can be used to restore sensation to limbs that have been lost, reduce pain, and prevent seizures to name a few applications. In all of these applications the stimulation selectivity, which is the ability to activate targeted neurons without activating off-target neurons, determines the efficacy of the treatment. In efforts to increase stimulation selectivity, newly designed peripheral nerve electrodes have generally decreased the axon to electrode distance -by either increasing invasiveness or reshaping the nerve- while only using monopolar stimulation. In the following work, I will leverage modern computing techniques to consider novel extraneural contact placements in an electrode. Additionally, I will be using simultaneous contact stimulation (SCoS) to shape the electric field in the nerve in order to provide more selective stimulation. This is done by having currents that are active on up to 46 contacts at a time. By combining high density extraneural contact placements -including longitudinal contacts- with SCoS and having an algorithm optimize this stimulation, we can find non-human intuitive electrode designs that are capable of providing selective stimulation _in silico_ using only extraneural contacts.

  

Selectivity

- Improve sensation areas, paraesthesia in pain modulation
- Various hardware solutions: invasive, higher contact density, nerve reshaping
    - Bring axons closer to contacts
- Optimaization of FINE Schiefer M et al 2012 - probabalistic modeling
    - Bipolar is more selective: current in one and adj or opposite contact
- Time: angle, contact spacing, mon/tripolar
- Brill simultaneous contact stimulation - srround anode
- All contact, simultaneous conatact stimulation: electrode ind, axon specific vs fascicle
    
    - Obj fxn to maximize selectivity
    
    ![[Untitled 452.png]]
    
- Simulate PNE
    - US → isolate fascicles → place them in COMSOL within FINE → FEM record voltage for each contact from one contact sitm → can linearly uperimpose to get axonal responses from multiple contacts
        - Random distribution of axon diameters
    - Use selectivity measure in genetic algo to find ideal stimulation
- Electrode design: simulate and assess selectivity, remove contacts as you go
    - Save contact geometry that when changed cause a sig drop in selectivity from previous geometry
    - Cluster these geometries
- How selective is selective enough??
    - Would we know what to do with axon level selectivity
    - any other stim would be a subset of this approach
    - Most valuable for sensory restoration
- Hwo do you modulate the functional outcomes
    - Dependent on person’s anatomy

**Title:**  **Focal (direct-on-nerve) photobiomodulation may reduce pain via selective small fiber inhibition**

Investigating direct photobiomeodulation for pain relief and translatability

**Abstract**:  Chronic pain poses a high burden on the economic, physical, and mental well-being of millions of individuals.  Development of complementary non-addictive approaches to pain relief is a significant need. One intriguing possibility is carefully-dosed photobiomodulation (PBM) at levels that appear to selectively inhibit small fiber action potential propagation (i.e., direct block of nociceptor/thermoceptor activity).  The objective of the present study was to expand our understanding of direct-to-nerve PBM dosing by evaluation of a single application of PBM (using one of several different doses) in a behavioral model (spared nerve injury (SNI)) of chronic pain in the rat. Small fiber thermal (Hargreaves) and large fiber mechanical (von Frey) sensitivities were measured over a period of several days after a single application of PBM. Thermal changes at the nerve and adjacent muscle were measured for the doses we applied. These data provide important insight into PBM doses that effectively inhibit activity (presumably by selective small fiber block) using the direct-to-nerve application model, as well as insights into the thermal character of this approach. Ultimately, the data from this study may support the development of translational tools, such as implantable systems, that use inhibitory PBM to directly block nociceptor activity without impairing large fiber sensory and motor activity.

  

  

What protein is being altered by the absorbed light?

- Multiple chromophors, not sure of the mech

  

Do results of electrophysiological studies translate to behavioral models

  

Chronic pain

- Need long lasting small fiber selective pain treatment, minimal side effects

PBM: 630-1000nm

- Previous work is transcutaneous : high power needed (possible eye injury), only modest pain relief weeks later
- Direct PBM selectively reduces AP propagation in small-dimater fibers
    - Is the drop due to velocity reduction, no longer constructively interfere

Hpoth: direct PBM will reduce fiber sensitivities for small fibers, large fiber sens unaffected for >2 hrs

- Spared nerve injury model: sciatic nerve splits
- Other branches cut, surval nerve intact , consistent withdrawal response

Thermal test for small fibers, force for large fibers

- Dunn-Sidak correction

![[Untitled 453.png]]

- No effect on larger fibers
- Small fiber sensitivity effect, ~1 week following treatment
- Power is more effective at same energy levels but can be compensated a bit with longer duration

Is it thermal heating?

- 808nm is relatively low absoprtion by water
- Below damage threshold, degeneration of axons + tissue
- Lower powers hit even lower temperatures
- Muscle heating has similar response

Heat based block

- not enough applied power to reach heating threshold

Small vs large?

- Size difference? Myelin?
- High water absorbing wavelengths: K channels thermal response (were able to block the block, in heating water absorption range)
    - Surface effects → preference for small fibers
- All gates speed up with temp, K speeds up faster: opening too soon to get AP
    - Acute effects
- Consider combine heating + PBM? bring down heat threshold, increase duration of PBM

Speculative mech: PBM increases nitric oxide that selectively blocks small diameter axon Na channels

- Many chromophores for 808 nm: reactive O, nitric oxide, ion channel changes, mircotobule disruption
- Redford, Kapoor, Smith Brain 120 , 1997: dose response to NO
- Nitrosylation of Na Channel: O=N bound to thyl group, decrease in overall conductance of Na channels

**Title:** **Quantifying the S1 cortical response and perceptual response to peripheral nerve stimulation-evoked sensation in humans - Figure Feedback**

**Abstract:** Individuals with tetraplegia or limb loss may experience diminished to no sensory feedback, which impairs their ability to perform dexterous movements and feel socially connected with others. Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) can restore the sense of discriminative touch by electrically activating afferent fibers. While advanced stimulation paradigms are being developed to enhance sensation naturalness, the relationship between PNS patterns and the response in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) remains unclear. Over the past couple of years, I have been studying how sensory percepts evoked by PNS are represented in S1 in an individual with tetraplegia who is implanted with both cortical and peripheral interfaces. In this presentation, I will share some of my preliminary figures for the resulting manuscript in preparation and welcome feedback on them.

Stimulation was delivered to a participant with sensory-incomplete, AIS-B C3/C4 spinal cord injury through individual contacts of 16-channel Composite Flat Interface Nerve Electrodes (C-FINEs) placed around the median and ulnar nerves. We modulated the pulse width (PW) of PNS. PNS trials were pseudorandomly presented over a total of ten conditions: control (no stimulation), six equally spaced PW values that spanned the sensory dynamic range, and three equally spaced PW values below threshold. After each stimulus, the participant was asked to report the perceived intensity of the resulting sensation. Additionally, multi-unit action potentials were recorded from two 64-channel microelectrode arrays (MEAs) implanted in S1. The normalized firing rate was calculated to quantify neural modulation.

Title: Clinical Implementation of a High Channel Count, Bidirectional Somatosensory Neuroprosthetic System  
Abstract: Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation using Flat Interface Nerve Electrodes (FINEs) and composite FINEs (C-FINEs) and myoelectric sensing using Tetra Intramuscular (TIM) electrodes can restore touch and relay motor intentions for upper extremity prosthesis users. However, the upkeep of the percutaneous leads, high wire count crossing the skin, and burden of using an external stimulator may deter prosthesis users from adopting the system at home. With this motivation, our team developed a high channel count implantable device with wireless communication for both stimulated somatosensation and myoelectric sensing: the implanted Somatosensory Electrical Neurostimulation and Sensing (iSens®) system. In this study, we characterize the chronic stability, evoked somatosensory percepts, and myoelectric performance of the iSens® system. Two participants with transradial amputations enrolled in the study and received the iSens® implant. Both participants’ iSens® systems include four 16-channel C-FINEs on the median, ulnar, and radial nerves and four TIMs in residual muscles, totaling 64 stimulating and 16 sensing channels. Cathode-first, charge balanced square pulse trains were applied at each contact to determine perceptual threshold charge across visits. Participants described sensation qualities and circled sensory locations on a tablet. EMG was recorded with and without stimulation to determine the extent of stimulation artifact in EMG. Non-increasing threshold charge values indicate that nerve health is preserved post-implantation. The iSens® system provides somatosensory percepts that almost completely cover the phantom hand. The stimulation artifact in EMG varies in magnitude depending on the recording channel, and therefore, ignoring high-noise myoelectric channels may be required to develop robust control algorithms.

  

Sensory only home going

- Psychosocial improvements
- Not a lot of functional benefits - possibly due to 1DOF myoelectric

ISens: different topology as NNP

- Which parts come from which companies?
- Ardiem: interesting that we can still collaborate and make devices!

Characterize long term ability to elicit sensation and can we stimulate while recording emg signals

Features from inc or raw extracted then you calculate?

- I Sens does normally calc features , processing on smart sens lead
- Raw only for a subset of channels
- DSP in smart leads for 8 features per channel

FDS: contraction

- Extension? Cross talk, co contraction what's the signal there
- Both part while extending, finger flexors are still activated
- Goal is repeatability of the action

One participant had noise in EMG from sense

- May be due to a broken lead one half of bipolar, it didn't appear from the beginning
- May have to ignore in algo

Where there elements of the design to address emg / sensory artifacts

- Yes
- Ref electrode is case of smart ?
- How features of artifact compare with real emg signal
    - 2 channels, the noise magnitude is higher
    - Maybe it's freq dept
    - How does the decoding perform with the other electrodes, there's some redundancy in electrodes
    - Can't manually process raw eng
- Can't just implement a filter
- Could calc freq dep features
- There is structure in the noise

**Title: Neural Population Dynamics of Simultaneous Finger Movements in Human Motor Cortex**

**Abstract:** Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs), combined with Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) movement neuroprostheses, can be used to restore functional reach and grasp movements to those with tetraplegia. The ReHAB clinical trial aims to enhance the capability of BMI + FES neurotechnologies by restoring dexterous hand function. Current BMIs scale poorly to high degree-of-freedom (DoF) movements such as coordinated finger movements, due in part to our incomplete understanding of how the brain generates motor commands for several joints simultaneously. Previous studies have shown neural population activity in motor cortex during single joint movements is well modeled as a dynamical system that evolves in time following intrinsic dynamical rules. We studied the spatial and temporal modes of the neural dynamics during simultaneous finger movements and their relation to those observed during single finger movements. We found that the trajectories traced out in neural state-space during each movement condition were confined to separate low-dimensional manifolds; however, the dynamics within each manifold were consistent across the conditions. Additionally, we found that there is a linear relationship between the location and orientation of each multi-finger movement condition’s manifold and those of the single-finger conditions that compose it. These findings offer key insights into the underlying principles governing the activity of motor cortex during simultaneous finger movements, which may potentially be leveraged to enhance the capability of the ReHAB system and BMIs in general.

**Title**: Injectable and Bioabsorbable Peripheral Neural Interfaces for Minimally Invasive Neuromodulation.

**Abstract**: Aligned with the guiding principle of ‘keep it simple,’ our lab is developing and evaluating injectable and bioabsorbable peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) for minimally invasive neuromodulation.

The Injectrode (Neuronoff Inc.) is an injectable helical wire structure that was designed to simplify surgical procedures for placing and removing implantable neurostimulator leads. We assessed the chronic performance and function of these implanted leads in a rat sciatic nerve model as demonstrated in evoked electromyography recordings, evoked motor thresholds and device-tissue impedances. Preliminary histology at 12-weeks showed expected fibrosis around our implanted leads and ingrowth within the coiled structure.

Our lab has also developed a bioabsorbable electrode platform designed to be fully degraded by the body. The electrodes were fabricated using simple sputter-coating methods that yielded 100 nm gold coatings on an absorbable suture substrate. The proposed suture-based electrodes were electrically functional for up to 4-weeks in benchtop “accelerated aging” studies and up to 2-weeks _in vivo_ under minimal strain (implanted subcutaneously in the back). However, implants failed after only a few days when placed on the sciatic nerve which undergoes frequent strain.

In this talk, I will discuss some of our design process in developing PNIs and showcase preliminary _in vivo_ results of the two electrode platforms under development.

PNS Interfaces

- selectivity v invasiveness design to achieve nerve specificity + selectivity
- Industry concerns: company business model, funding, manufacturing at scale, value prop (market, IP)
- Challenges: surgery, hard to manufactures at scale
- Perc leads = state of the art rn
    - SPR therapeutics

**Title:** Electrically Elicited Sensations to Reduce the Risk of Falls for Individuals with Lower Limb Loss

**Abstract:** Over 1 million individuals are living with lower limb loss in the US. Over half of them report falling or avoiding day to day activities because of their fear of falling. Plantar sensation contributes to maintaining smooth and stable gait and preventing falls by providing information about how the body is moving in space and modulating reflex excitability. In our lab, individuals with lower limb loss have been implanted with high density nerve cuff electrodes around the remaining nerves in their residual limb. Delivering electrical stimulation through the electrode contacts can elicit sensations that feel like they are coming from the individuals' missing foot, and the intensity of this sensation can be modulated based on foot-floor interactions. In this study, we seek to understand how this electrically elicited sensation contributes to stability during gait to ultimately reduce the risk of falls for individuals with lower limb loss. First, we characterized how the electrically elicited sensations are integrated in spinal reflex pathways. Then, we evaluated how the electrically elicited sensations contribute to recovery from treadmill-induced stumbles.

  

Sesnation

- Info on body position, modulates spinal reflex pathways
- Effects a variety of user needs
- H reflex: no effect, muscles may have been repositioned post amputation
    - Not interfering with pathways or excitability
- Dynamic gait

**Abstract**: Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition for patients, resulting in para or tetraplegia. Brain computer interfacing (BCI) offer a way for paralyzed patients to regain movement, thus improving their quality of life. Penetrating implantable electrodes that are able to obtain single cell resolution such as Intracortical microelectrodes (IME) are necessary components in BCI. Unfortunately, these IMEs demonstrate steady decline in performance over time ultimately resulting in device failure. Chronic neuroinflammation has been shown to be a major contributor of device failure, exacerbated by oxidative stress and micromotion. Current industry standard devices rely on stiff substrates, resulting in high differential strain between the device and brain tissue that exacerbate the effects of micromotion. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by activated immune cells such as microglia and macrophages cause damage to the device material and to the cells in the vicinity, leading to neuronal death. A device has been developed that aims to decrease differential strain by utilizing a mechanically adaptive polymer nanocomposite material comprised of tunicate cellulose nanocrystals (tCNC) in a polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) substrate, that is stiff when dry to facilitate insertion, but becomes soft when wet. Additionally microfluidic channels were integrated into the device for antioxidant drug delivery to reduce oxidative stress. The fabrication method has been optimized to produce devices that reliably and chronically deliver drug solutions. Devices underwent benchtop testing to validate function and implemented in pilot in vivo studies to determine an optimal microfluidic design. The chosen microfluidic design was used in a full in vivo study that aimed to determine the extent of inflammation mitigation achieved by soft materials, antioxidant delivery, and their combination as compared to industry standard silicon single shank probes. Bulk gene analysis was used to determine the extent of inflammation.

  

  

Need chronic resveratrol delivery to reduce oxidative stress

hybrid: compliant microfluidic probe + resveratrol

Nanocomposite: lower expression of inflammation genes

Push away from immunohistochemistry toward more advanced techniques, genomic, proteomic etc

- log2fold changes
- H&E can miss things easily

How does shape of probe affect collapse ?

- Mat becomes compliant, brain tissue puts pressure

**Title: Tactile percept formation and integration for object feature encoding with electrical stimulation**

**Abstract**: Touch is a sense that is often taken for granted, but it is critical to use and manipulate objects, feel ownership of one’s body, and make meaningful connections with others. Composite flat interface nerve electrodes (cFINEs) have been used to successfully restore touch to upper extremity amputees, changing how they grab objects and interact with those around them. Prior work using cFINEs revealed the relationship between stimulation paradigms and sensation at a single point of perception, such as the index fingertip, at a time. However, touch requires integrating multiple sensations across the finger and hand for tasks such as object recognition (stereognosis) and improved manual dexterity. For this study, an interleaved stimulation pattern was used between contact pairs to elicit multiple percepts on the hand. Stimulation pulse amplitude and frequency for these contact pairs were varied. The main hypothesis is that multi-contact stimulation with little to no axon population overlap will result in non-linear addition of tactile dimensions of sensation. For example, the overall percept area during interleaved stimulation will be significantly different from the sum of the areas resulting from single contact stimulation. Preliminary results have revealed trends in location, quality, and intensity integration during multi-contact stimulation that depend on percept size, location, orientation, and intensity during single percept stimulation. Understanding these integration patterns is vital for understanding how multi-percept stimulation could inform object feature extraction.

  

  

Importance of touch generally

- Multi percept touch is useful
    - Opposite fingers: functionally, grabbing an object
    - Overlapping on same digit
- Spatial + temporal encoding of object features
    - High firing rate with edge detection
    - Stereognosis: coarse feedback, discriminated by # of contacts
- Multicontact: TIME electrodes, combining contacts combined the sensation
- Static stereognosis: varrying PA + PF across multi contact stim affects sensation (intensity, location, quality)
    - Multicontact, varying PA : collect location maps + selected terms
- Nonlinear addition of area as PA increases
    - Differences in digits
- Same result in intensity for M2 and combination

Q&A

- Dealing with large paramater space
- Think about it in terms of neurophysiology (smaller diameters have higher thresholds)
- Could the decrease in area be a CNS thing or an attention focusing thing?
- Synapse activation of next neuron isnot one to one

Title: **Investigating the Role of the Gut Microbiome on Brain Implants**

Abstract: Intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) record neuronal action potentials in the brain and can be paired with external systems to provide motor function rehabilitation to those with disabilities. Unfortunately, recording quality of MEAs consistently declines over the course of weeks to months, compromising device utility. Neuroinflammation from persistent indwelling of MEAs is considered a significant contributor to the decline in recording performance. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may play a role in brain health possibly via bacteria-specific metabolites or microbiota infiltrating through the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, we hypothesize that altering the gut microbiome in mice via oral antibiotics or probiotics could change the microbiome composition in both the brain and gut, affecting neuroinflammation and MEA performance. Weekly feces samples were collected for 16S bacterial analysis. After 12 weeks, brain samples were collected to analyze 16S bacterial compositions along with transcriptomics and proteomics to quantify effects on neuroinflammation. Bacterial culture was also performed to measure live bacteria in the brain and feces. Bacterial microbiome analysis indicate distinct populations of gut microbiome across groups, corresponding to treatment. Biweekly neural recording sessions indicated temporal differences in MEA recording performance. Acutely (Weeks 1-5), antibiotic-treated mice (79% active electrode yield, AEY) and probiotic-treated mice (75% AEY) showed significantly better MEA performance than control (68% AEY). Probiotic significantly outperformed antibiotic sub-chronically (Weeks 6-11) and chronically (Weeks 12+). Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on brain tissue is underway to understand the correlation between MEA performance, microbiome composition, and neuroinflammation following MEA implantation and treatment. At minimum, our data suggest a connection between microbiome composition and recording performance. Such evidence provides a novel means for understanding and improving the lifetime of MEA devices to be used chronically in humans.

  

Chronically loses ability to record driven by biological response from body

- Glial scar build up
- Hard to dodge vessels so how do we mitigate the response
- CD14 knockout study: prevent macrophage activation

Non implanted: not a lot of bacteria detected in brain

  

Different groups: different bacteria compositions - antibiotics, probiotic

- Full study with 4, 12 weeks groups; bi weekly neuron recordings

  

Antibiotic: acute improvement but past 7 weeks rapid decline compared to control

Probioitic

  

When we implant, shift in bacteria in gut + brain: probiotic, alter microbiome back to normal healthy levels

**Title: Towards Restoring Sensation and Improving Tissue Health in Amputees with Diabetes**

**Abstract:** Diabetes is the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States, contributing to 73,000 amputations per year. Many of these amputations are a result of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a loss of peripheral nerve fibers due to elevated blood glucose levels. Damaging sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves in the extremities, DPN contributes to difficulties with prosthesis use and poor residuum tissue health in this population, leading to poor functional and clinical outcomes. I will discuss the potential for applying sensory nerve stimulation in amputees with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and my work with traumatic amputee participants developing tissue health metrics that can be applied as the project moves forward.

  

DPN independent of fiber type, but length dep: extremities first

  

Losing ability to regulate peripheral vasculature

- Loss of vasoconstriction - AV shunting, blood doesn’t reach capillary bed
- Loss of vasodilation - no axon reflect, poor thermal regulation

Sensory autonomic interactions

- Sensation + embodiment may be realted to how resources are allocated
- Sensation of nerves via TENS can cause changes in blood flow

Leverage sensory nerve stim for these effects

  

![[Untitled 468.png]]

- Sensory autonomic connection: measure tissue perfusion + a reflex to test
- Method to probe autonomic nervous system + absent in DPN: experimental condition to test + distinguish between traumatic and DPN amputees

laser doppler: dependent on flow placement , best for comparison on same subject

Perfusion changes due to sympathetic activation

- Need to account for other factors
- Measure conductance = flow / pressure gradient

  

Activation threshold in terms of temperature: ~42 C

  

Proposed effect of sensory stim on

- Activate autonomic reflect pathways in absence of skin heating
- Alter temporal chars of thermal axon reflex w/ stim and heating
- Change thresholds of activation

  

Can a fine activation sympathetic fibers in the nerve?

- Trying to find out!

  

Screening first DPN:

- Cutaneous pressure thresholds, semmes weinstein filament test
- Sensory nerve action potential: reduced axon density but could feel sensations

  

Research with spinal cord stim

- Usually to treat neuropathic pain
- Could be potential if you modulate correct reflex circuits

Would like to intervene before limb loss

Monofilament test

- Unshaded area: 2nd highest filament

  

Block shunting/ to improve vascular flow?

- AV does have a purpose, standing up to prventing blood flow to capillaries
- If you could modulate it might be useful

  

Will need to characterize + think about which fibers you’re activating

- Hard to measure autonomic measurement

  

Do trials even in contacts with no sensation, the fibers you may want may not be in sensation areas

  

“Excellent talkl, Hannah. Particularly strong physiological basis for your hypotheses and methodology.”

**Title: Chronic Nerve Health of a Novel Interfascicular Peripheral Nerve Interface**

**Abstract:**

Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is currently used for a range of applications including restoration of tactile sensation and the treatment of chronic pain. Peripheral nerve interfaces have historically been limited by the intersection of selectivity and invasiveness. If selectivity is maximized by interfacing directly with axonal populations, the blood nerve barrier is interrupted which can result in axon loss and demyelination. In contrast, currently used extra-neural electrodes are limited in their selectivity. In this talk I explore a new class of interfascicular peripheral nerve interfaces which penetrate the nerve’s outer membrane while keeping the blood nerve barrier intact. I am specifically focused on understanding the chronic tissue response to interfascicular electrodes, and will discuss electrode development, validation, and plans for histological assessment of a chronic implant.

  

PNS

- Pain modulation and sensory restoration
- Anatomy: paranerium - tougher tightly regulated memrbane, epinerium, fascile
- Classify by selectivity (activate subset of axons), invasiness (interaciton with axonal population)
    - Surface - TENS, circumneural - CFINEs interface with epinerium (still a barrier to stim, foreign body response), intraneural - UTAH array, regnenerative
- Selectivity: touch - percepts + evoking natural sensation, pain - activate non pain large fibers / high freq block, FES specific muscles
- Invasive: blood nerve barrier
    - Housed in perinurium, tight jxns to regulate exchange, structural integrity
    - Rupture BNB: axon loss, demyelination - slower conduction, changes to G ratio (iinner axonal / total diameter w/ myelin)

Interfasicular: beneath epinerium, between fascicles

- Single intrafasciular contact tests of selectivity: vary orientation Mech test: perinurium is much harder to penetrate: could maybe find an ideal youngs modulus wire (normallizied normal angle)
- Expect changes with non-normal insertion angle? Definitely possible

Evaluate body response to such an electrode

Design electrode: challenges with surgical approach, insertion + retention

- Ulnar as sciatic alternative: superficial compared to sciatic, similar morphology to human nerve
- Looking for the correct wire at first, didn’t work
- Micro cannula: designed to avoid bruising in face for insertion (did not puncture micro vasculature)
    - 50 nm wire, stripped part in wire, rest won’t slide through
        
        ![[Untitled 469.png]]
        
    - Friction holds wire in nerve

Acute validation via MicroCT: implant, fix + stain, 3D model

- Isolated wires in blender!
- micro CT: hadn’t pierced fasicles it appears
- Morphologies: wire sits on fasicles, between fasicles

Chronic implantation

- motor contraction illicited

Histology next post explant: G ratio, axon density, capsule morphology

  

Question;

- Anchoring? damage from electrode movement
- How does surgeon know not to pierce epi., Utah array type electrode actually takes a lot of force to pierce, unlikely it would happen by hand
- Mechanical damage to probe?
- Wire? stainless steal for now, going to move to platinum irridium
    - Coil wires vs straight
    - Stress concentrations at grain boundaries in platinum
- Goal is for insertion non srugically, shot

**Title: Exploring Transcutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation to Elicit Tactile Sensation**

**Abstract:**

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive method of peripheral nerve stimulation that involves passing current across the skin to activate neurons. While TENS has historically been used for clinical applications like pain relief and functional electrical stimulation, it also has the potential to elicit tactile sensation. Specifically, surface stimulation of the digital nerves in the fingers has been preliminarily implemented to communicate the sense of touch in both virtual and remote environments. However, there is still a need to explore the space surrounding digital nerve surface stimulation paradigms to investigate the potential modulation of tactile sensation features such as perceived quality and intensity. This talk will examine the use of TENS for tactile feedback and discuss avenues to maximize the technology's impact in industry and research.

  

Touch Background

- Fine motor control + emotional communication
- Perceived intensity : total injected charge
- Perceived location: surface skin location , how reliable , large
- Perceived quality: mech of modulation still unknown, related to waveform + temporal pattern
- Sensory Peripheral nerve stim
    
    ![[Untitled 470.png]]
    

Why non-insvasive

- Surgical risk
- Sensory augmentation in XR: AR/MR, virtual/remote reality
    - Market? growing field, effective in anatomy education
- Benefits: improve functional performance (surgical haptic feedbacks), better patient/physician relationship via telehealth (therapy, reduce phobias)

Previous Sensory Work with TENS

- D’Anna 2017: not natural sensation (cutaneous , tingling), did get consistent intensity
    - Monopolar forearm
- Shin 2018: bipolar bicep, unreliable access to ulnar nerve

What can we do

- Get closer to nerve? 12mm-16mm, 8-12mm - forces you to use higher currents
- Activate smaller branches for spatial selectivity ?
- Not limited by muscle activation threshold?

Anatomical targets

- Digital nerves: 2.4 mm deep, only sensory fibers at this point (no efferent counterparts)
    
    ![[Untitled 471.png]]
    

VR setup!

![[Untitled 472.png]]

- Cameras to track hands

Stimulation

- Intensity modulation: PA 3mA, modulate PW, 80Hz pulse freq, square wave
- Set individual min + max
    
    ![[Untitled 473.png]]
    

VR Task

- Confetti feedback on correct placement
    
    ![[Untitled 474.png]]
    
- Stim either on or off binary, could modulate based off distance hand pressed
- Do they get practice with pre labeled items?

  

Location

- Multiple electrodes one for each digital nerve, map dermotomes

Quality

- Still artificial quality
- Improving stim with a larger patient population

Looking into waveform modulation

- Varying waveform
- Depolarizing prepulse: TENS give cutaneous + referred sensation, prickly sensation may come from cutaneous area
- Mono vs biphasic: mono caused less acute skin irritation
    - longer pulse width (didnt need to correct with anodic wave), lower PA needed

  

  

  

Questions

- Why not mechanical stim for tacticle with XR + able bodied?
    - CES haptics : quality is set, bulky setup
    - Electrical has higher ceiling for a variety of qualitative stim
    - AR: leaving fingertips open to interact while still affecting sensation
    - Mechanical delays
- Selectivity? Use ultrasound to focus
    - Temporal summation in PNS?
- Game, was habituation an issue with game?
    - intensity range does change over time: range starts narrow, new uncomfortable sensation at first
- Lower limb: changes with standing + sitting
    - Do you expect sensations to change when actually touching an object vs grasping at the air
    - Some of the change of sensation is a result of nerve movement : TENS keeps movement reduced
    - Can you eventually learn stimulation scehemes
- BMI affecting things?
    - charge stimulation for women is lower, still similar perception ranges
- Variability / repeatability across doning situations
    - Cutaneous illusions to get at spatial area
    - Min as fxn of anatomy, max fxn of psychology
    - Patience to calibrate can be problematic
- digital nerves: carrying efferent sympathetic? causing sweating
    
- Looking into the emotional connection??

You mentioned that one of the benefits of touch in XR is an emotional connection? The game you showed seems more focused on the fine motor control side but do you plan to look at how touch improves

**Title: Cell-Specific Spatially Resolved Proteomic Analysis of the Intracortical Microelectrode-Tissue Interface****Abstract**

: Intracortical microelectrodes (IMEs) are devices implanted in the motor cortex of the brain that can be used to record the electrical activity of local neurons. This activity can be used to predict the desired movement of patients, and can be sent to brain-computer interfaces (BCI) such as prosthetics or wheelchairs. However, such BCI systems fail over chronic time points, largely due to the neuroinflammatory response of the surrounding tissue to the implanted IME. Many studies have been performed testing different electrode materials and drug therapies to mitigate this inflammatory response, but there is currently no treatment to fully prevent IME failure. It is not entirely known which genes and proteins contribute to this response, and only a few studies have looked in-depth into the gene expression at the implant site. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the processes that lead to device failure, a spatiotemporal, cell-specific analysis of the genes and proteins involved in the inflammatory response is necessary. Identifying key pathways that are affected by electrode implantation could lead to the development of new therapies to improve the long-term performance of IMEs. This study evaluates the expression of over 80 proteins surrounding the implant site. Protein expression measurements were divided into different segments based on 90 mm concentric rings, and were further divided based on cell type. Cell-specific capture of expressed proteins allowed for the quantification of protein expression within our selected cell types (neurons and astrocytes). Our study represents the first proteomic or transcriptomic study of IME implant sites to implement cell specificity and is overall the most comprehensive analysis of the proteins involved in the IME neuroinflammatory response that has been performed.

**Title – Impact of somatosensory feedback on grasp force control**

**Abstract-** Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have the potential to restore intuitive sensory and motor functionality to persons with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Restoration of hand and arm function has consistently been ranked the highest priority among those with tetraplegia. A significant amount of research has been done on kinematic (position and velocity) control but research on kinetic (force- related) control is limited. However accurate modulation of grasp force is necessary for object interaction to maximize the functionality of restored movement. Previous studies have shown the presence of kinetic information in the cortex and the possibility of using this information for decoding of intended grasp force level. However, these studies also demonstrated that using only visual feedback led to low decoding accuracy of grasp force from cortical activity. In addition, it has also been shown that the neural representation of force in the cortex during force-matching tasks without sensory feedback was lower than expected. This was demonstrated through a decreased volume of cortical activation and low differentiability of population activation patterns. These issues with insufficient grasp-force control could be due to a lack of somatosensory feedback because of the significant role of somatosensation in fine control of grasping forces. Furthermore, task-relevant somatosensory feedback has been shown to increase the neural representation of stimuli and lead to better decoding accuracy. Task-relevant somatosensory feedback can be provided through intact somatosensation for those with incomplete SCI while intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the somatosensory cortex can be used to provide tactile feedback for those without intact sensation. In this project, we explore the effect of the inclusion of somatosensory feedback through intact somatosensation and ICMS on the performance of grasp force control and the neural representation associated with it. Aside from an increase in understanding of the effects of somatosensory feedback on motor control, the improvement in grasp force control performance and an increase in the neural representation of force can lead to better BMI control of the upper limbs.

  

Background

- Higher levels of spinal cord injury, tetraplegia
- Restoration of hand / arm function is highly requested
- intracortical brain computer interface + FES: not yet able to modulate grasp force control
- Suggestion that somatosensory sensation is important: foot movement had less MRI activity , maybe due to last of sensory input
- Low decoding accuracy of grasp force: only visual feedback on screen: Downey et al 2018
    
    ![[Untitled 475.png]]
    
- Above change but too low to be reliable, could be due to lack of somatosensory feedback
- Low force representation after tetraplegia

How does somatosensory feedback affect neuronal representation and performance of grasp control

- Feedback approach: remaining intact vs intracortical microstim - current to brain
- Some areas not engaged vis ICMS, still need to investigate for sensory incomplete individuals

Not attempting to exactly replicate typical pattern of a burst at onset and offset of force application

- Stimulating single vs multi contact: advantages to doing multiple with less current, increase longevity of electrodes

What’s behind the degradation of electrodes when you push current through it

- Degradation even without pushing current through them, assumption that more current would lead to more decay
- Usually oxygen degradation: dissolution of platinum at some point

**Title:** **Task-driven Functional Connectivity Modulation in the Human Cortex****Abstract:** In addition to the primary motor cortex (M1), the Anterior-intraparietal area (AIP) and the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) are two very attractive sites for Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) targeting hand movement restoration, given their demonstrated activation during movement planning. Together, these three areas constitute the visuomotor grasp network, which underlies the execution of a large variety of grasps and hand movements in both humans and Non-Human Primates (NHPs). Even though task-driven functional interactions between the different components of the grasp network have been vastly explored in NHPs, a high-resolution temporal profile of these interactions at the spatial detail level of single neuronal assemblies have not yet been demonstrated in humans. An improved understanding of the dynamics of information flow within this network could prove essential to the design and implementation of more efficacious BMIs.The current study in the Ajiboye Lab records neural activities intracortically from all these key hand areas (AIP, IFG and M1), thus providing an opportunity for a high-resolution characterization of task-driven spatiotemporal information flow within the grasp network homologue in humans. The use of multiple high-density microelectrode arrays in our recording setup, however, presents some challenges in using well established statistical techniques for inferring functional connectivities between different brain areas, including high computation. The first goal of my project is to design an optimal data analysis framework for characterizing information flow suited for neural data recorded from multiple high-density microelectrode arrays. Preliminary results, based on computational modeling, show that the “true” connectivities (information flow patterns) between different nodes within a complex brain network can be accurately computed by first performing multivariate decomposition of the high dimensional signals from the recording microelectrode arrays, followed by Multivariate Autoregression of the resulting low dimensional signals. When tested on empirical data from closed-loop aperture control experiments, this framework produced AIP-IFG interaction dynamics consistent with the current view of information processing within the grasp network in NHPs.The second goal of my project then is to use this tool to characterize the specificity and task-dependent modulation of the grasp network homologue in the human cortex by studying the relative levels of spatiotemporal information flow within this network while a human subject performs different tasks such as speech, closed-loop grasp control and mental computation.

**Title: Proprioception Restoration for Upper Limb Amputees**

**Abstract:** When an amputation occurs, proprioception in the missing limb is lost and previously simple motor tasks can become much more difficult or even impossible to accomplish. Proprioception is the body’s sense of limb position and velocity in space and is a vital part of motor planning. Current cutting-edge neuroprostheses can elicit a rough sensation of proprioception using peripheral neural interfaces in amputees. However, these devices do not yet fully replicate the proprioceptive acuity of an intact limb. One limiting factor is the gap in literature concerning the design and implementation of proprioception-specific stimulation paradigms. Many previous stimulation studies also do not account for the agonist-antagonist muscle interactions that are integral to natural proprioceptive sensation. Additionally, it is unclear what the primary mechanism of proprioceptive sensation through peripheral nerve stimulation is, whether it be direct muscle spindle fiber activation or off-target muscle activation. Another challenge is determining how this mechanism may differ between amputees with or without TMR (Targeted Muscle Reinnervation) or TSR (Targeted Sensory Reinnervation). Previous data suggest an involvement of the contraction of the muscles of the residual limb in peripherally-stimulated proprioceptive sensations in the phantom hand, as proprioception and residual muscle EMG appeared to be correlated. Further data demonstrate an effect of pulse frequency on proprioceptive stimulation. Based on these preliminary results, I propose a framework for developing a new proprioceptive stimulation paradigm through the comparison of agonist and antagonist pulse frequency modulated stimulation in unilateral upper limb amputees with and without TMR/TSR.

  

  

What is proprioception?

- Body’s sense of limb position, force, velocity from…
- Inputs
    - Muscle spindles: I and II, change and muscle length
    - Ruffini’s endings: skin stretch
    - GTO: muscle force
- Agonist/antagonist interactions: lengthening of bicep during extension - increased firing rate of I and II, opposite in triceps
- Justification: needed for complex tasks, reduce visual reliance

  
Platform: peripheral nerve stim, C-FINEs

- Stim: PA, PW, freq
- Unsure of mech that leads to proprioception : could be activating muscle spindle afferents or muscle efferents
    - Primary muscle spindle size may affect size

  

Current state of restoration

- Often muscle contraction + proprioception observed
- Could be reflex arcs , could be from several sources

  

Targeted Sensory Reinnervation: denervated skin reinnervated by sensory nerves

- sensation generated at former innervated area

  

Full picture

![[Untitled 480.png]]

  

Proprioception Matching

- Match position of phantom hand (joint angle), EMG of residium
- EMG correlated w/ proprioception
- Pulse freq related to range of motion: similar to muscle force activation

  

Aims: fxnal improvement

- Compare agonists and antagonist only stim
- Determine effect of combined agonist-antagonist stim
- Determine ability of userse to id hand postures using proprioceptive stim

  

Prelim Exp

- Mostly prop. PA threshold > observable muscle contraction

  

Aim 1 Hypoth: increase agonist pulse freq will increase joint flexion ROM, antagonist increase joint extension ROM

![[Untitled 481.png]]

- Vary freq above tetanus , constant 250 us, PA at threshold
- Measure ROM during stim, EMG, TSR vs non TSR

  

Q&A:

- Can you use stim to create a “stretch” vs contraction
    - Will mostly be timing
    - See if we could stimulate below the natural firing rate of muscle tone
- Could potentially compare virbotactile
- Use grapevine instead of UECU to reach higher 600us pulse width
    - minimize fatigue to keep consistency across trials
- Use muscle paralyzing agent to eliminate source of spindle inputs,, keeps nervous system excitable
    - Affects contraction + not conduction
    - Concern about length of time muscles would be out, need them to control prostheses
        - Agents used in surgery
    - Simplify possible pathways
- Data
    - What patient reports from proprioception: any amount of phantom changing configuration
    - Can you rely on phantom hand sensations from patient to patient?
        - How do you normalize different participant thresholds
- How are tendons of muscles secured in amputees
    - Attached to bone
    - Antagonist and agonist will not directly affect each other as is : need to stim both in some way
    - Linked at proximal joint, could affect each other then
    - In lower, surgery can be conducted to link them
- Efferent stim: AP affect CNS as well
    - Role of muscle efferent contraction in proprioception, what is known?
    - Where do they go? contribute to sense of effort?
- Nerve cuff electrodes to recruit motor fibers to create proprio
    - IM electrodes and go to muscles directly? Is cuff the best interface
    - Could maybe do it as a proof of concept: steel may not hold up long term

**Living with a Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS), a Patient’s Perspective**

Deep brain stimulation is one of the most widely used interventions for a variety of movement disorders and diseases including but not limited to essential tremor dystonia and Parkinson's disease. Patients experience a great deal of physical and social anxiety because of their tremor that often prevents them from doing specific tasks in certain social situations. A patient must weigh the risks and rewards of undertaking this surgical intervention. As a current patient living with essential tremor (ET) who received DBS, I will cover: 1) The social anxiety one experiences living with a movement disorder. 2) What goes into making this decision 3) pharmacological interventions  used prior to DBS. 4) What quality of life changes I experienced after implantation 5) Current disadvantages to having DBS. My goal is to elucidate my peers on what some of us work on everyday and show that there are real world improvements to peoples lives in the research that is being conducted even though we may not be able to see it right away

**Title: Utilization of the grasp network for dexterous BMI-FES control.**

**Abstract:** There are roughly seventeen thousand new cases of spinal cord injuries annually in the United States with almost 50% of cases resulting in complete or incomplete paralysis from the neck down. When persons with tetraplegia were asked, the number one function that they wish they could have restored is hand function. While the Ajiboye Lab (LIMBS) has been able to restore a single hand grasp to our previous participant with tetraplegia, the goal of my research is to expand this to include a number of grasps sufficient for activities of daily living. Previous literature indicates that two cortical areas, anterior intraparietal (AIP) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), contain information about hand grasp that has not fully been utilized in a BCI-FES system. AIP, IFG, and M1 together form the grasp network which is responsible for taking in visual stimuli and translating it into a motor command (visuo-motor transformation). The focus of my research is to determine how different aspects of grasp are encoded in the cortex (Aim 1).  Previous NHP and human research indicates that AIP should modulate to object type (i.e., sphere vs. rod) whereas IFG should modulate to grasp type (i.e., power vs. pinch grasp). Preliminary data on this aim was collected using a visuomotor task where the participant was instructed to attempt to make one of five grasps randomly cued on a screen. Neural single feature analysis of the channels in IFG shows that there are multiple channels that have a significantly different normalized firing rate in comparison to a screen blanking period. In addition, there are a number of channels that show significant differences between normalized firing rates of different grasp pairs. Current progress on population level activity has begun utilizing principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and demixed principal component analysis. My second research goal is to determine how sequences of grasps are encoded in the cortex (Aim 2). Current research on reach sequences indicates that there is neural modulation to each reach in the sequence that can be detected even before the reaches are executed (in a premovement epoch). To our knowledge no similar experiments have been carried out in human BMI participants for grasp sequences. Future experiments will be conducted for sequences of randomized grasp pairings to investigate whether neural activity of future sequenced tasks are present in premovement epochs similar to reach sequences.

  

Background

- SCI : low recovery rates, lack of ind + lots of comorbidities
- Hand + arm function highly wanted
- Object Interaction: reaching, wrist orientation, hand grasp
    - 6 grasps for ADL
- Previous work: can restore single grasp w/ BMI + FES
    - Only from M1 + only a single grasp

Hand Grasp

![[Untitled 482.png]]

- Grasp Network: visual feature extraction in primary visual cortex, AIP gets affordances (areas to interact), potential motor act (F5/FG) → motor execution M1

  

How are different aspects of grasp are encoded in cortex?

How are sequences of grasp encoded

![[Untitled 483.png]]

  

Aim 1:

- Looking to extend primate studies to human
- Anderson Lab: imagine grasping, above chance classification accuracy for grasp-object epochs in movement epoch in AIP
    - IFG modulation in humans: increased firing rate in premovement epoch
    - Also above chance accuracy for pairs
    - Did not look at individual grasp + obj effects
- Ajiboye prelim: confirmed M1 findings to a high exercise

  

Prelim Data IFG

![[Untitled 484.png]]

- Normalized spike band power: one way anova between grasps + channels
- Grasp vs screen blank has large difference, much smaller between grasp types

![[Untitled 485.png]]

![[Untitled 486.png]]

- LDA: pick out neurons that modulate one condition ex grasp
    - Can’t see if grasps are similar but can see if they are seprable
- PCA: mixed components, unsupervisied
- dPCA: can pick out a component specific to each condition
    - separation + similarity
- Results
    - Not separable in PCA space: grasp not separating data
    - LDA: vs Anderson lab + our own M1 data
        
        ![[Untitled 487.png]]
        
        - Quite low: 5-10% above change
    - dPCA: difference between DPCA + PCA
        - Grasp is not changing data the most

![[Untitled 488.png]]

- Increase in firing rate but can’t differentiate grasps

  

Questions

- Why doesn’t the visual difference show up in statistical analysis
- Overfitting: randomly leave out part of data in training process to combat overfitting
- Matlab includes features by how much ind info it adds, otherwise doesn’t include it
    - helps to prevent overfitting

  

Experimental design:

![[Untitled 489.png]]

- Attempt to recreate shown grasp

Aim 2: sequences of grasps before execution

- Previous lit
    
    ![[Untitled 490.png]]
    
- single, two reach with delay in between, two with little delay
- Ind hypothesis is true!

![[Untitled 491.png]]

  

Questions

- Object with obvious weight differences?
    - Not asking to grasp with significant or different amounts of force
    - Someone else looking at attempted force effects on data: was a sig difference between light and hard grasp
        - Would you have to separate that out / control for that
        - Assume all similar weight + holding without crushing
- How does power + disk grasp differ
    - Disk is claw like, power grasp has more finger closure
- What are translational benefits
    - Other BMI FES controllers decode from one area
    - We want to make smart decoder that looks at info from entire grasp network
    - Bi directional communication between parts of the network: as grasp progress there is feedback from AIP and new information can come back and influence AIP
    - How it influences decoder specifically: more accurate assumption of intended movement by looking at multiple areas
- Also look at ANOVA

**Incorporating stiffness modulation into upper limb neuromuscular stimulation systems**

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of arm and hand muscles combined with the decoded motor intentions from intracortical recordings can restore reaching ability to individuals with spinal cord injury.  Our goal is to improve FES-generated arm movements by incorporating real-time adjustments in limb stiffness in addition to limb kinematics.  In our previous study, we have developed ways to automatically modulate limb stiffness based on the intended limb velocity command decoded from the brain.  Here we build on that method by now addressing two key practical issues: 1) balancing stimulation across multiple redundant muscles, and 2) optimizing stimulation of biarticular muscles.  With these advances, we demonstrate, through simulation, how to generate an upper limb FES control algorithm that is clinically practical to implement and allows one to control limb stiffness in addition to kinematics.

To better understand how limb stiffness can be decoded from neural populations, we have trained macaques with intracortical microelectrodes to perform an EMG-controlled cursor task in which independent activation of antagonist muscle pairs control one dimension and a separate dimension of movement is controlled by their degree of cocontraction.  Preliminary results suggest some information about cocontraction can be extracted from the motor cortex.  Results from these studies will help improve restoration of reaching after paralysis by demonstrating a clinically practical stimulation control method that includes stiffness modulation as well as identifying ways to decode reliable volitional stiffness commands from intracortically recorded neural signals.

  

Limb Stiffness

- Coactivation of antagonist muscles: flexion + extension torques around a joint
    - Limb can be in same place with differing levels of torques that equal out
- Practically results in less displacement to a force
- Stiffness is unconsciously controlled + changes during movement, don’t want excessive amounts (fatigue)

Neuromuscular Stim Systems

- FES: electrodes activating muscles
    - Add BCI to decode motor command signals from brain
    - Typically decodes velocity or position, stiffness overlooked
- One way to make FES controlled: lookup table of empirical data of muscle activation vs elbow position

Automatic Stiffness Modulation

![[Untitled 492.png]]

- Same position but same stiffness: what level should we use for efficient movement
- Can’t practically answer this w/ FES user: fatigue, muscular atrophy
- Dynamic Arm Simulator: 2D transverse, elbow + shoulder rotation
    
    ![[Untitled 493.png]]
    
- Assume bell curve of intended velocity
- Use acceleration + vel:
    
    ![[Untitled 494.png]]
    
- Identifying C1-C3 params by evaluating time to target, path length, energy used (total muscle activation)
- Start with low then high stiffness as you get closer
    
    ![[Untitled 495.png]]
    
- Using just kinematic info → 20% less energy !
- Question: how generalizable would conclusion be to other velocity profiles?
    - Velocity will start and end at zero, increase in middle → acceleration profile remains similar
    - Suspected to be generalizable

Volitional Stiffness Modulation

- Decode limb stiffness as well via BCI
- Neural signals: are they correlated with co-contraction + not just biceps / triceps : all are slightly different
    - Central sulcus had heavy modulation for co-contraction : shape matches stiffness curve
    - Several neurons in this area have x6 x3 times activation during co-contraction
- Cross validation: good for no activation + co, ~70%, less so for Bi or Tri
- Looking at human data, closed-loop stiffness modulation, another subj, direct muscle decoding vs intent

Clinical Translation

- How? make model realistic, step by step method to make look up tables, distribute activation to avoid muscle fatigue
- Realism: previous muscles only had one function
    - Added biarticular (affects multiple joints) + redundant muscles
        
        ![[Untitled 496.png]]
        
- Kinarm system: move arm as desired, record / apply torque
    - Record passive torques at stationary positions
    - Quantify torque vs stim amplitude for each muscle at each point in workspace
    - Predict torques to put arm in position w/ specific stiffness
        - Net torque = 0 from passive , flexion, extension torque
        - And flexion + extension create stiffness level
            
            ![[Untitled 497.png]]
            
        - Desired stiffness - torque: not same units
            - Stiffness quantified as balanced torque
    - Translate torques to muscle stim for table
    - Test + revise table: see where arm actually goes
- Position error as a result of sampling resolution: up to controller designer, error vs data points to collect

  

Questions

- Any discernable torques in a passive position? Higher far away from center
- Are there other factors besides the acceleration profile? presumably yes, choose acceleration for its relation to distance to target
    - Moving closer to face = more stiff vs moving away
    - Could be a directional component
    - kinda covered by acceleration + deacceleration

**Role of electric fields in generation and propagation of epileptic activity**

Neural recruitment in epilepsy occurs in part due to electric field (ephaptic) coupling in addition to synaptic mechanisms. We have shown that neural activity like theta waves, epileptic spikes and seizures can cross a physical transection _in vivo_ using electric fields thus propagating independent of synaptic transmission. Hence, controlling the local electric field could suppress or cancel the generation of these epileptic events. We tested the hypothesis that clamping the local extracellular electric fields in a known focus can prevent the generation of epileptic spikes and seizures in the hippocampus in-vitro. 100 % of the induced epileptic activity originated from the temporal edge of the hippocampal slice. An extracellular voltage clamp system was connected to the recording electrode and applied a feedback current through stimulating electrodes to maintain the voltage equal to zero. When the feedback circuit was turned “on” the electric field produced by the applied current cancelled the local extracellular electric field involved in the generation of the epileptic events as evidenced by the clamp achieving 100% suppression of both epileptic spikes and seizure events. No spikes or seizures were observed in the septal region when the clamp was “on”. When the clamp was turned off both the spikes and seizure events recovered. An extracellular voltage clamp applied to a known epileptic focus can completely supress the generation of the epileptiform activity and prevent its propagation away from the focus. Although the spatial extent of the control is currently limited to the region around the recording site, this method could be effective to control seizure generation in a small known focus.

  

Epilepsy

- treatments: meds, lobectomy, cuts to prevent propagation
- MST only successful in 1/3, large electric fields can propagate across cut

Aims

![[Untitled 498.png]]

  

Aim 1

- Make a cut + induce seizure (4ab) , asses proagation
    - No sig difference in delay or propagation speed
- Introduce a glass slide that should electrically isolate recording 2 form 1: success
    
    ![[Untitled 499.png]]
    
- 1b: epileptic activity can recruit neurons in the cortex

  

Aim 2 epileptic progagation in hipocampus in vivo

- Saw propogation along length
    
    ![[Untitled 500.png]]
    
- Spikes spread after cut and consistent speed and delay as in vitro
- What kind of spikes propogate?
    - Spikes closer to cut, which cross?
    - Larger spikes of narrow width do, smaller wider do not
    - And glass blocks propagation

Aim 3:

![[Untitled 501.png]]

- Need to know where focus is
- Ra is measurement, differential amplifier maintains voltage at focus R1
    
    ![[Untitled 502.png]]
    
- Complete suppression in recording one and two !
- Could be a lingering post effect
    
    ![[Untitled 503.png]]
    
- Extracellular clamp: not affecting just one neuron
- Spike amplitude does change with higher gains
- Moving recording electrode doesn’t pick up spikes, clamp won’t activate

Aim3b: LTP induced in CA3 neurons by simulating mossy fibers

- Is synaptic transmission unaffected by clamp ?
- Long term memory not affected

  

Questions

- Translational applications?
    - How feasible is implantation of this
- Test in vivo next
- Haven’t tested in unfolded hipocampus / in vivo / 3D
- Has inserting a dielectric material been tried for epilepsy?
    - Not sure, gels have been used
    - Theoretically could adjust the dielectric properties via electric stim
    - No material exists yet, large surface would cause issues w/ cytokine accumulation + neuron death
- What type of neurons do you think are affected by clamp? histology?
    - What would you target antiseizure meds for in clinical use
    - Main target is densely packed neurons
    - Constant application, feedback loop via drug delivery
- How to manage charge injection considerations on the clamp electrodes?
    - For long duration? 30 mins, spikes do come back
    - Have to test in 3D version to assess synaptic transmission

**Title:** **Peripheral Nerve Stimulation as a Tool to Study Emotional Touch**

**Abstract**: Humans can convey emotional meaning solely through touch. This ability likely relies on a combination of receptor organs in the skin and central processes to translate pressure and movement patterns into salient affective content. In intact sensation research, the delivery of different touch paradigms and resulting emotional content has been extensively investigated; however, it can be challenging to investigate the roles of individual components of the system. Using patterned peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) to generate perceived moving touch offers the opportunity to study individual components of the emotional touch system and how discriminative and affective components interact. This talk will explore the current state of affective and emotional touch research and how illusions of moving touch can be paired with PNS to further our understanding of emotional and affective touch.

  

Background

- Focus on discriminative touch: palms, interact with objects
- Affective touch: how you should feel about touch
- CT fibers: respond to stroking, relationship between velocity and pleastness + temp
- Pleasantness not inhibited by cordotomy
    - Different pathway?
    - Argument for central processing: reaction to touch changes based on environmental context

Experiments

![[Untitled 504.png]]

- 20 emotional cues , receiver had much more to choose from
- Components
    
    ![[Untitled 505.png]]
    
- Similar strategies emerged
- Virbotactile rig constructed to re feed the stimulation patterns
    - Coarse delivery method still delivered discernable emotion in touch

Movement across skin in intact sensation

- Continuous contact innervation, artificially we make an illusion
- Modulate intensity - Tactile Phi Phenomenon: you feel a point between two stim points + it can move, static point only for a while
- Apparent Moving Sensation: two points delivered sequentially
    - Done at certain rations of ISOI/duration - single moving sensation between the two
    - Limit in stim parameters

Methods

- Two points + vary ISOI/duration ratio to see how perception changed: location drawings, number of distinct percepts (sensations), order, if described as movement more info
- 1 sec trains

Results: participant level of amputation, interventions varies

- Participant movement did feel movement: movement not in expected direction + “in phantom” did not follow path between points
- Movement but extreme variability : where touch is happening can change perception
- Convergence of all sensation that affects final perception: vision VR??
- Could not elicit consistent movement

Movement can be defined differently by the participant

- Reporting proprioception via this terminology?

  

Same set of fibers throughout the experiment

Timing phenomenon in the circuitry?

  

Stretch goal: convey emotional information

**Title: Effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) on binocular coordination of saccades and strabismus angle in Parkinson’s disease (PD)**

**Speaker: Palak Gupta**

**Advisor: Dr. Aasef Shaikh**

**Abstract:** Vergence insufficiency and impaired saccades contribute to depth perception deficits, poor navigation, and increased fall risk in PD patients. 1/3rd of PD patients also have strabismus and disabling double vision. DBS is becoming increasingly common for improving general motor symptoms of PD. We examined the effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS on the binocular coordination of saccades in PD. An objective analysis of gaze-holding and saccadic eye movements suggests that saccadic abnormalities and strabismus are prevalent, significant, and interrelated in PD. Our results suggest that STN-DBS also affects the neural pathway common to both vergence and saccades, possibly by acting on the STN–substantia nigra pars reticulata–superior colliculi pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and may yield better treatment strategies, including using STN DBS.

  

Background

- Establish neural circuitry influenced by PD
- Discharge in STN affecting entire network
    
    ![[Untitled 507.png]]
    
- Vision Impairments 82%
    - Double vision, compromised depth perception, trouble reading
- Midbrain: SOA - ocular motor behavior

  

Saccades: rapid conjugate movement for reading, scanning

- Slow unstable movement in compromised individuals vs smooth rapid movement
- Strats for PD
    - Slowing in lower plateau
    - Staircase effect
    - Failure to before gaze shift at all
- slowing, fragmented, asymmetrical behavior

Correct w/ STN-DBS

- Moderates misfiring patterns
    
    ![[Untitled 508.png]]
    
- Main sequence analysis
    - Amplitude (10 degree) and velocity
    - # of steps performed
    - DBS caused decrease in # of steps required + less complete failures
    - Duration: time to target degree
    - Latency went down: time to execute movement
    - less asymmetry
- Ability to hold eyes at target location

  

Q&A

- What’s the mechanism of DBS effect
    - Misfiring effects primarily affecting midbrain supraocular motor area: disconjugacy here
        - Cerebellum
    - Second path: dorsal aspect of STN
    - Top right = cortex visual processing , upstream in addition to downstream
        
        ![[Untitled 509.png]]
        
- Test it
- Clinical consequence for the patients?
- Parameter sensitivity to improvement?
    - Future work is heading in that direction
- Instructions to patients?

**Title**: **Visualizing Micro anatomy of Neural Structures and Reconstructing Vagal Anatomy with Micro CT**

**Abstract**: Understanding micro-anatomy of neural structures is a critical step toward developing better neural interface technologies. The results obtained from imaging fine neural structures can potentially inform improvements in stimulation therapies and help to minimize potential for off target effects. Traditional clinical imaging techniques (CT and MRI) cannot provide the high resolution necessary to investigate neural micro-anatomy. We used microCT to demonstrate that, on average, at least one fascicle in the human vagus nerve at cervical level splits or merges every 560 microns. In our current studies, we used a similar approach to image the swine spinal cord to investigate the dorsal root organization and expanded on imaging and mapping the Vagus nerve anatomy using multi-modal imaging techniques.

  

Background

- Epilepsy: info graphic w/ numbers affected, costs, types of seizures
- Common treatments
    - Drugs: side effects
    - Surgical resection: removes part of brains; invasive can cause memory + fxn loss

Neuromodulation Approach

- Non-invasive vagus nerve stim: not as effective
- DBS: invasive + similar memory loss side effects
- Surgical Vagus Nerve Stim: cuff electrode around trunk of vagus nerve (FDA approved for certain patients not eligible for resection)
    - Detection of heart rate ^ (20% hike)
    - Vagus stim to NTS to locus coruleus - norepinephrine containing neurons
    - Side effects: shortness of breath, voice changes

Side effect investigation

- Activation of nearby neck muscles - motor fibers in vagus nerve

Targeted simulation: reduce side effects

- Spatial organization of vagus fascicles unknown
- Typically use histology but there’s limited resolution

Osmium Stained Micro CT Imaging

- Staining, dehydrated + put in mold, markings for cm lengths of nerve
- Micro CT in blocks, reconstruct entire image
- Measure dimensions + dynamic organization of fascicles
    
    ![[Untitled 510.png]]
    
- Multiple branches, bright spots

  

Previous Conclusions: 1 cm window

- 17.8 splitting + merging events: 14 events across 8mm of standard electrode
- Heterogeneity in samples + dynamic morphology in single sample
- Apply to other neural structures: pig sacral spinal cord

  

Challenges to Osmium protocol: toxic, lipid binding causes bright spot artefacts (prevents machine learning), diffusion in larger samples (incomplete penetration of stain)

  

PTA phosphotungstic acid: binds to collagen (no lipid artifacts), no data on myelin

- Multi days of staining
- Rehydration to counter ethanol dehydration

  

![[Untitled 511.png]]

- Gross mapping: macro level mapping, major landmarks, bifurcation points
- Automated block face imaging - MUSE
- IHC: automated slide stainer

  

Hypotheses

- Light regions could relate to myelin, correlation of higher gray value regions in CT to myelination
- IHC: confirm bimodal organization, motor fibers on one side + sensory on the other (fxn based organization towards ganglion)

  

Questions

- Open type design = more flexibility but more current outflow, contributes to side effects

![[Untitled 512.png]]

- Therapeutic applications?
    - Currently VNS is last resort - invasive + heterogeneity: want to make it a primary treatment via selectivity
- Efficacy of non-invasive nerve stim?
    - n = 100: some had increased seizures , some had no effect
    - Modeling shows they are unlikely to stimulate vagus nerve: effects may be due to placebo
- Closed loop vs closed loop efficacy: data appears kinda mixed
    - not sure
    - Shoffstall targeting distal regions for stimulation to get specific effects
- Look at mapping from POV of single axon
    - Would want to separate afferent vs efferent
    - Why just focus on motor, most of efferents are not motor but releasing neurotransmitors
- Lots of markers: won’t know function necessarily but
- So much branching + merging seems counter intuitive
    - Developmental causes
    - Track the nutrient / O uptake ? can see vasculature in MUSE
    - Mechanics cause? telephone cord strain relief from tugging
    - Paraganglia: smaller neuronal bodies within vagus, reflex arcs + pathways

**Title:** **Understanding the Mechanisms of Low-Frequency Stimulation in Rodent Cortical Slice Preparations**

**Abstract:** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures that may involve brief episodes of involuntary movement, loss of awareness and consciousness. Epilepsy, currently, is managed and is not curable. Current epilepsy management methods include broad-spectrum drugs, high frequency-deep brain stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. All three of these approaches have a seizure suppression rate of under 75%.  A new modality of stimulation called Low-Frequency Stimulation (LFS) shows promise. When LFS is applied to white matter tracts, it is capable of both spreading to grey matter areas innervated by the target white matter tracts and is capable of suppressing seizures in the grey matter areas by up to100%. Though there is evidence and past research suggesting that LFS can work remarkably well for seizure suppression, there is no information about how it is able to do so. My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of how LFS of the corpus callosum fiber tracts reduces epileptic activity within the cortex.

  

Epilepsy

- abnormal electrical activity
- Can currently just be managed

  

LFS

- less damage to titssue, electrodes
- Thought to reduce neural excitability
- LFS to white tissue then spreads to gray matter

Past experiments show ability of LFS to spread into tissue

- Hippocampus, corpus callosum

  

Mechanism: hyper polarization

- GABA receptors
    - A and B: inhibitory response, neuro transmission
    - Allows influx of Cl, reflux of K, and reduction of GABA from pre synaptic neuron
- Slow after hyper polarization
    - K effluent from Ca or Na activated channels

  

Trying different blocker combinations

- GABA B and SHP

  

Same mechanism in cortex?

- epilepsy in detail
    - Focal: specific regions
    - Generalized
    - Unknown onset
- Cortex has significant impact

  

In vitro

- coronal brain slices from mice
- Brains sliced
- Exposed to O, temp and ACSF to stay alive
- Glass microelectrodes: Ag, Ag Cl wires

  

Aim 1: trigger consistent seizures, over 20 seconds

- 4-AP, Ca, Mg ions: change concentration in artificial cerebrospinal fluid
- Model 4: correct time scale, consistency across brain slices
- Moving average to verify behavior over time

Aim 2: looking for optimal sim Paramus, 80% suppression rate

- 3 20 min segments: baseline, stim, post
- Freq 1,5,10,20 hz
- Current 90 % of max evoked potential
- 100 us pulse width
- Electrode position
- Results: 5 hz reduced time seizing most,
    - Amplitude is dependent on electrode positioning and damage
    - How consistent is the amplitude, is it variable in a single experiment at one frequency
    - Changing within and between slices

  

Pair pulse trst

- Hyper polarized, depolarized, testing
- Stim cause depolarized
- Adjacent neurons also can get activated : release their own neurotransmitters
- Stimulating again, we see smaller response : inhibitory response
- In seizure model: hyper excitability region
    - Hyper excitable compared to control in non and seize model

  

Aim 4: using blockers for GABA B and saHP

Future: in vivo model

  

Very good clarity, a bit fast

  

  

  

Initial segment lengths and excitability drops: interesting bc there’s more channels so you would think the opposiite?

**MOVING HEALTH DATA: Making Data More Portable Than Patients.**

The Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS), composed of 30 autonomous Tribal Health Organizations, provides care to 170,000 Alaska Natives at more than 200 sites throughout Alaska.  This is an especially challenging and complex system of care given the extreme geography, isolated communities, and socioeconomic characteristics unique to Alaska. Only 25% of communities in Alaska are located on the road system, leaving off-road vehicles such as ATVs, snow machines, boats, and small planes as the primary means of travel in the remaining 75% of remote communities. The average rural resident in Alaska travels 147 miles to see a nurse or doctor.

Twenty-five years ago, this system relied on dialup connectivity, paper records, phones and faxes to coordinate patient care.  Emerging technologies (including telehealth and EHRs) have enabled the ATHS to shift to a robust system of care that, in many cases, provides a standard of care not achievable in other health care systems.  Rapid expansion of communications have led to a world-class telehealth system, shared health records, and coordination of care over a land mass covering approximately one-fifth that of the entire 48 contiguous US states

The presentation will include some of the key designs, engineering principles, and studies that led to improvements in health care over the past 25 years.

**FUN TOPIC**

Thirty-eight years ago, a group of graduate students at the Applied Neural Control Laboratory at CWRU began a journey that continues to this day.  Despite the many mistakes, unplanned adventures, multiple rescues, and occasional hospital visits, this group continues to share their passion for climbing with each other and the next generation of climbers.  This will be a light hearted romp through history, with the occasional lesson learned but mostly the mistakes that made it fun.

Title: **Center of Mass Estimation for Gait Control and a Baseline Gait Analysis After SCI**

**Abstract:** For over a decade, individuals after a spinal cord injury (SCI) have identified restoration of walking as a top priority. Current approaches use feedforward systems to apply functional neuromuscular stimulation to lower extremity muscles to automate stepping. However, these neural stimulation paradigms result in discontinuous, variable, and asymmetrical gait patterns. To achieve more nominal gait patterns after SCI requires a feedback controller that tracks and corrects for errors in a control parameter. The center of mass (CoM) is a kinematic parameter that follows well-defined trajectories during nominal gait and is highly associated with stability. Thus, to stabilize post-SCI gait, we developed and trained a Long Short-Term Memory neural network to estimate each dimension of the CoM profile from inertial measurement units (IMUs). Five healthy subjects participated in a single session of various dynamic walking trials with body-mounted sensors. A neural network was trained with 100 neurons in a single hidden layer using the data collected. After fine-tuning the network parameters and achieving accurate estimations of COM kinematics, we explored how the number and location of the IMUs affected the neural network’s accuracy. From this exploration we plan to select a neural network for our feedback model. In addition, we conducted quantitative gait analyses on current feedforward stimulation systems to assess and quantify their performance. We compared gait variability and symmetry metrics from 2 individuals with SCI and the 5 able-bodied participants under the various walking conditions. In this presentation, I will address the results from training the neural networks and the baseline gait analyses. These results provide the framework for our feedback controller for normalizing gait patterns post-SCI.

  

Background: SCI have poor quality of life, walking movement remains top priority

- Walking fxnally useful for transport, helps prevent chronic disease

Fxnal neuromuscular simulation: feed forward control

- Jerky behavior, asymmetry, discontinuous, upper extremity effort needed
- Need for feedback model

COM Kinematics

- Used for control, has well defined patterns over gait cycle, associated w/ stability

Aim 1: relationship betwixt COM accuracy + number / location of IMUs

![[Untitled 522.png]]

Scenarios

- Able bodied w/o walker, Continuous with walker, Step then push walker, no plantarflexion (locked ankle)

LSTM neural networks:

- COM isn’t a directly measured quantity
- Linear acel, angular velocity, magneti: 9x12
- Each axis has own network
- Gold standard of reflective markers
- Term to reduce overfitting

![[Untitled 523.png]]

- No IMUs on forearms: possible implanted systems, arms in use w/ assisted devices

  

Results

- Similar kinematics for walker vs no walker
- Significant change when replicating SCI gait dynamics
- Training
    - AB 1-4 testing, test it’s generalizability with AB 5
    - Need to investigate generalizability further

  

Simplify input data:

![[Untitled 524.png]]

- 127 configurations per network: trained it every time
- 12: 4,096 configs
    - PCA to reduce dimensionality
- Oblique rotation: assuming some correlation betwixt sensors
- Chest sensors contribute to 1st PC, shin + feet to 2nd, abdomen to 3, thigh to 4th: could simplify these groupings

  

Training with new sensor combos

- 8: remove middle sensors + feet (smaller mass, hard to implant sensors)
- Different combos of hitting each of the 4 principle components

![[Untitled 525.png]]

- No sig dif except for 3 sensors betwixt 3 + 12
- Between 2nd and 4rd to last: would prefer slightly higher RMSE bc it has sensors on both sides

  

Baseline Gait Characteristics

![[Untitled 526.png]]

- Variability: step length / time, stance, time, stride length, swing time, single + double support time, velocity
- 9 vars w/ L + R —> PCA : 12 comp —> Gait Deviation Index

![[Untitled 527.png]]

- Discontinuous pattern causes sig dif but not dif with or w/o plantar flexion
- Symmetry: 0 = perfect symmetry , 100 = perfect asymmetry

![[Untitled 528.png]]

- Sig dif for cont. vs discon. and plantar flexion

  

Next Steps + Future Work

- What accuracy of COM estimation is needed to create normal gait
- Analyze stability metrics
- Real-time testing
- Feedback controller

  

Q&A:

- Were AB subjects shown SCI walking vids? Likely should have, could incorporate more asymmetry , foot turning
    - Worst AB still better than best SCI

**Title: Investigating selective stimulation of STN neural elements through polarity of stimulation**Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in the STN is a proven therapy for treating refractory Parkinson's Disease patients. Since the FDA approval of this therapy in 2002, there has been little exploration in one of the stimulation parameters that most affects which neural elements are modulated by stimulation – stimulus polarity. Further understanding of stimulus polarity would allow for better therapy optimization and DBS therapy expansion to other neurological disorders. Initially, neurostimulation pioneer James Ranck described the effect of polarity - cathodic stimulation generally first engages axons of passage whereas anodic stimulation preferentially engages local cells with axons projecting away from the electrode. Theoretical work in intraspinal microstimulation and cortical stimulation supports Ranck’s assertions. Recently, a small-scale clinical study demonstrated that monopolar anodic stimulation improved symptom relief of patients with Parkinson's Disease beyond monopolar cathodic stimulation. This talk will describe a two-pulse technique that leverages the absolute refractory period to isolate field potential responses from neural elements selectively excitable by a single polarity (anodic or catholic) and propose computational methods to identify optimal parameters to measure polarity-specific responses.

  

Deep Brain Stimulation:

- Treat’s parkinson’s, tremor, other possibilities
- First order stim target unknown: theories around local STN cells, zona incerta, hyperdirect pathway elements
- Current optimizations are cathode-centric: PW + rate, monopolar cathode + bipolar
- Bipolar: cathode + anode on lead

Now there are commercially available anodic devices

- Initial studies still used cathodic optimization

![[Untitled 529.png]]

- Rationale of this specific study?
    - Cathodic has just what has been available - good stimulation efficiency
    - first principles say anodic will activate different nerve elements, let’s see if there’s a clinical difference
- Theoretically more improvement possible if anodic optimization was used
- Are there differences in the first order target of anodic vs cathodic STN-DBS

Theory

- Rank: in certain cell orientation, anodic stim was more effective
- Intraspinal microelectrodes model: again in specific orientation, activation of cells was easier with anodic current, act of fibers easier with cathodic
- Surf electrodes on motor cortex: anodic —> efferents vs cathodic —> afferents

![[Untitled 530.png]]

- Difference in channel density?? For now focusing on a higher level, could be worth incorporating

  

![[Untitled 531.png]]

- Evoked response: various neural elements
    
    - Cathodic or anodic stim excites those specific elements + non-specific ones
    
    ![[Untitled 532.png]]
    
    - Theory: response of non-specific overshadows the polarity specific elements
        - This approach can’t differentiate targets

  

Proposed dual pulse technique for either polarity

- Apply second anodic pulse during refractory period of first pulse: hit anode specific elements only

![[Untitled 533.png]]

  

Preliminary Results

- Response ratio: area of test / area of conditioning pulse: expected to be 0 for Cath, cath or anode, anode
- Delay betwixt pulses = < 1ms (300-500 micro sec)

![[Untitled 534.png]]

- Some response differences in C to A and A to C
- Color bars = different electrodes stimulated
- After ~2ms practically independent activation: ratio ~= 1
- Stimulator used: monophasic pulse, off the shelf hardware
- Artifact Removal: uses dual pulse setup, second pulse cancels out initial signal and you are left with only artifact

  

![[Untitled 535.png]]

Q&A

- Intra vs extracellular stim: probabilistic with extracellular, will me hundreds of stim with same parameters
    - Optimization approach takes some of this into account: conditioning pulse is meant to over engage
- Cortical recordings in these experiments? Not sure but would be interesting

**Title: Balance Control Strategies for a Hybrid Neuroprosthesis**

**Abstract:** We developed an algorithm to estimate center-of-mass to be used as feedback for a self-balancing controller for powered exoskeletons. These devices aim to restore mobility for individuals with lower-limb paralysis, but commercial exoskeletons are unable to self-balance, which forces users to exert more upper extremity effort to stay upright.  Our team has developed a hybrid neuroprosthesis that combines electrical stimulation to activate the user's muscles while electric motors at the hip, knee, and ankle assist as needed to complete the movements. This talk will summarize our ongoing work in developing a balance controller for our hybrid neuroprosthesis and our plans to expand upon this concept for fall prevention and mitigation.

**Title: Developing assistive devices to restore mobility and independence after stroke**

**Abstract:** Poststroke gait impairments limit mobility and independence. Assistive devices that improve safety and walking speed and endurance could enhance quality of life and reduce secondary health effects. Electrical stimulation activating muscles crossing the hip, knee, and ankle in coordination with volitional movement may be an effective mechanism for restoring function. This talk will describe ongoing and upcoming projects developing and evaluating implanted and non-invasive assistive devices to restore function after stroke.

**Title: Mechanically-adaptive, antioxidant-eluting neural probes to mitigate intracortical microelectrode failure**

**Speaker: Natalie Mueller**

**Advisors: Dr. Jeffrey Capadona and Dr. Allison Hess-Dunning**

**Abstract:** Intracortical microelectrodes are used in brain-computer interface systems to restore function in spinal cord injury, limb loss, and neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, they often fail within months after implantation, leading to overall diminished therapeutic efficacy through reduced recording performance and increased stimulation thresholds. We have developed a mechanically-adaptive, resveratrol-loaded neural probe with the goal of improving intracortical microelectrode integration by reducing the neuroinflammatory response. This device utilizes local antioxidant delivery and a mechanically-adaptive material to target the mechanical mismatch and oxidative stress failure pathways. Previous work indicated that the neural probe showed improved neuron density and decreased microglia activation compared to traditional silicon probes. Currently, we are incorporating recording electrodes on the substrate to make these devices functional. However, we need to evaluate the effects of UV light and heat exposure from the recording electrode microfabrication process on the loaded antioxidant, resveratrol. Throughout release studies to determine resveratrol presence and activity, we have discovered possible material components leaching from the substrate, raising concerns about toxicity and inflammation. In this talk, I will discuss our resveratrol release methods, findings, and future work to successfully integrate recording electrodes while preserving the resveratrol integrity and reducing neuroinflammation.

Can’t just preprocess with the drug, drug washes away too

- Microfluidic channels could allow for it

Remains to be seen if mechanical properties change, electrical seems solid

Not sure if it’s just surface ellusion

- Still implantable at that size without cellulose

Previous lit showed PVA with cellulose is better

- PVA w/o cellulose could be better if the crystals cause inflammation
- Dip coated vs wire was better, but that could be due to softer mechanical mismatch
- Eluting version could be even better without interference from nanocrystals

Would want to go smaller, would need stiffening

- Worth knowing the effects of it

**Title: Characterizing effects of electrically elicited sensations on spinal reflex pathways**

**Abstract:** _Introduction:_ Individuals with lower limb loss are at higher risk of falling compared to able-bodied individuals. Plantar sensation plays an important role in maintaining smooth and stable gait, as evidenced by its modulation of reflex pathways. The H-reflex has been utilized as an outcome measure for evaluating the contribution of peripheral inputs in modulating neural reflex pathways [1]. C-FINEs were implanted around the sciatic and tibial nerves of an individual with transtibial amputation. Our team has demonstrated that delivering electrical stimulation via C-FINEs elicits sensations originating from the individual’s missing limb [2]. However, it is yet unknown whether these electrically elicited plantar sensations (EPS) can modulate reflex pathways in the same way as plantar sensation from an intact foot. _Methods:_ The participant adopted different postures by loading their prosthesis to 70% or 30% of their body weight (BW), while standing with their prosthetic in front of their intact limb. They received visual feedback to maintain the target posture. In each condition, a single pulse stimulus was delivered through a C-FINE contact (amplitudes between 1.2-2.6-mA) to evoke the H-reflex in the MG muscle. EMG was conducted using wearable sensors (Delsys Trigno). The experiment was repeated with and without EPS prior to the single pulse stimulus. M and H-waves were identified between 2-10-ms and 30-50-ms, respectively, after onset of the stimulus. PCA was applied to the EMG data in the specified H-wave window to identify the primary H-wave for further analysis to avoid non-reflex responses. H-wave occurrence was defined as the percentage of trials during which the primary H-wave appeared. _Results:_ H-wave occurrence consistently decreased over all stimulus levels when EPS was provided during 30% BW loading, with the maximum effect being a 33% decrease at stimulus amplitude of 1.8-mA. However, during 70% BW loading, the effect of EPS on H-wave occurrence varied over stimulus levels. When EPS was provided, H-wave occurrence increased at stimulus amplitudes between 1.6-1.8-mA, and decreased between 1.9-2.1-mA. _Conclusion:_ These findings suggest the effect of EPS on the H-reflex depends on afferent inputs from the residual limb. This shows that EPS is integrated with residual sensory inputs in reflex pathways, which agrees with how plantar sensation contributes to modulating the H-reflex in able-bodied individuals. This study reveals one of the mechanisms by which EPS may contribute to maintaining stability. _References:_ 1. Misiaszek, J. E. (2003). Muscle & Nerve, 28(2), 144-160. 2. Charkhkar, H., et al.

H-reflex modulated by sensation

- Reciprocal inhibition
- Vary interval between cutaneous stim and antagonist stim
- Walking on treadmill
    - Normally H reflex was straight
    - plantar stim restored typical H reflex amplitude modulation

SNP

- _slide 10 order of pictures_
- SNP can modulate H reflex in central processing
    - _kinda confusing diagram_

Hypothesis: characterize plantar sensation on reflex pathways

- Posture conditions: activate sensory fibers —> affects central processing
- Different posture conditions affects H reflex modulation

Experiment

- Occurrence of H wave, peak to peak amplitude response
- Under two posture conditions
- 18 _loading mimics posture during walking_
    - mimic postures of walking
    - Is the goal to induce a loading amount or a posture

Representative EMG

- M wave ~10 s after and H wve ~30 ms after stim
- H wave: primary morphology present, not all consistent, some have no response

H wave trace separation

- Principal Component analysis: find a dimension in data that best explains the variability
- Variation along this line the most
- _what do with this dimension, remove it_?
    - Seems to be just sorting by it
- Clustering
    - Separate out cluster 15

Results

- Fixed stim experiment
    - SNP seemed to decrease occurrence of H wave
- Multiple pulse amplitudes
    - 30% decrease again
    - 70% no effect!
- Distribution by amplitude
    - 30% posture: consistent decrease at all PA values
    - 70%: 1.6-1.8mA SNP increases H wave occurrence
- SNP modulates occurrence of H wave and modulate depends on posture!

Conclusions

- other sensory afferents (activated via posture changes) modulate modulation of the H wave
- No effect on amplitude

Future

- More H reflex data over range of stim amplitudes + more participants
- Evaluate impact of plantar sensation on recovery from treadmill perturbations

**First Implementation of DARPA’s Fully Implanted, BluetoothLE-Connected Bidirectional Neuroprosthetic System**

**Presenter: Sedona Cady****PI: Prof. Dustin Tyler**

**Abstract**: Peripheral nerve stimulation using extraneural cuffs can reliably restore tactile sensation to individuals with limb loss. Our lab has worked with five upper extremity amputee study participants across ten years who have been implanted with a percutaneous stimulation system. However, limitations to the percutaneous system include the high wire count within the body, the need for an external stimulator, and the inconvenience of maintaining the percutaneous leads. To address these issues, our team developed the Implanted Somatosensory Electrical Neurostimulation and Sensing (iSens) system. One study participant’s percutaneous system was explanted, and he was implanted with the new iSens system. In this study, we compare the stability of sensory locations, threshold charge values, and tissue impedances during the first six months post-operation. Stimulating through both systems provided unique percept locations along the hand, forearm, and upper arm. Threshold charge values for single-contact stimulation remained stable across six months for the iSens system, consistent with results from the participant’s percutaneous system. Tissue impedances from the iSens system, however, exceeded impedances calculated with the percutaneous system. Results from this work suggest that the iSens system provides stable sensory percepts for at-home use with a prosthesis.

System Performance

- Battery life hoped to last for multiple days for home

![[Untitled 569.png]]

- Hub can connect to computer/phone, other one to prosthesis
    - Hub to phone = USB
    - CAN bus, autoboc standard, analog connection for standard EMG
    - Plan to use with DEKA LUKE arm, Tasca hand, and b bionic
    - **Testing in virtual environment**
- Why not just phone? Hub has a higher update rate, general purpose OS on android phone isn’t good enough for real time, would need to remove android operating system
- Battery life data?
    - New chemistry for stimulators: should have faster recharge and better lifetime

  

Sensation Comparison

- Intact arm

![[Untitled 570.png]]

- Sensations during first year, 44 weeks

![[Untitled 571.png]]

- Median nerve cuff lines up w/ expected
- Radial (red) also consistent

![[Untitled 572.png]]

- M4: finger curling in

  

iSens Sensation

- 6 months for half, 2 weeks for other half
- Darker shading = more times circled
    - Generally consistent with adjacent contacts
- Threshold stim parameters: 100Hz, PA varied , 200-250 ms PW
- Could you use shorter PW and larger PA to change the topography? (area of sensation)
    - Looking into it
    - Some system limitation, shorter PW needs higher PA: INC needs to give more power when modulating PA up
    - Power at home may limit use of short pW
- Resolution of stim?
    - PW: 10ms more coarse than UECU
    - PA: 0.01miliA or 10uA
    - Freq: based on period, tested at only 100Hz
- Have found that 0-5PW does modulate size: threshold may be between the 10ms increments
- Power design limitations: power, clock cycle, PW resolution challenge
    - Strength duration curve: work on left hand side
    - High resolution PA, less so PW
    - Si has 8 volt limit, compliance challenge
    - Lead impedance: 3-6kOhms across body

  

Distal Median:: 4 weeks post op

![[Untitled 573.png]]

- DM12 question: participant likely just cut off drawing
- 1,2,15,14: matches expected intact innervation
- Farther to right = more back of hand: more consistent with radial nerve
- Index + thumb sensation still possible
- Quality: “vibration”, some as pressure, a couple tensing and squeezing (pink, whole hand)
- 11, 13 tactile vs 12 squeezing

  

Proximal Median: Aprill 2022

![[Untitled 574.png]]

- More in line with expected medial innervations
    - Some back of hand 14, 15
- Majority vibration, pressure; some tensing, 4,5 squeezing

  

Radial

![[Untitled 575.png]]

- Left side of cuff: similar area
    - Vibration, fluttering
- Middle: contraction based
    - Contracting, pulling, tensing
- Right: back of hand, in line with expected innervation
    - vibration pressure

  

Ulnar

![[Untitled 576.png]]

- New for participant, perc ulnar cuff opened up
- vibration, pressure, squeezing
- C5 stinging burning pain along whole forearm

  

Sensory Thresholds

![[Untitled 577.png]]

- Thresholds tend to be stable over time
- Range of thresholds is similar to perc system

![[Untitled 578.png]]

- Stable for about half, first couple weeks only half contacts had thresholds
- April: all but two had thresholds
    - Position of cuff relative to nerve: contacts may be too far away to reach with 250nC limit

![[Untitled 579.png]]

- Ulnar is lower: may be due to size of nerve relative to cuff size, need more data

  

Tissue impedances

![[Untitled 580.png]]

- Electrode not degrading, general nerve health

![[Untitled 581.png]]

- One sessions worth of data for half the system
- X-axis one contact
- Tested with return of radial nerve anode strip
- Generally higher impedances: may be a difference in methods
    - Compare to 107 vs 109 with CFINEs vs subj data with FINEs
    - Appears to still be higher

  

Issue couldn’t access half the system

![[Untitled 582.png]]

- Wire before bifurcation is crossing the joint (lower lead): surgeons did it over Medtronic suggestion
    - Off the shelf from Medtronic
- Ulnar and distal medial cuffs and IM electrodes
- Change intraoperative inspections
- Not sure of timeline on break: Jan to March 2022
    - Month after implant it was okay

    - Lack of slack as well
- Subject feelings on the setbacks
    - Been working with for 9 years, has experienced setbacks before
    - Patient
    - Been told it could end in nothing
- Is the stimulator small enough yet to just put it in the arm, not have to cross shoulder?
    - Don’t see why not besides size
    - Distribute components around
    - Easier charging perhaps
- Uncomfortable sensation: small diameter fibers perhaps? A delta
    - More details on physiologically what is being activated
    - Proprioceptive fibers have similar diameter to sensation
    - Pain fibers smaller
    - Usually sensory, motor, pain
    - Will have at least one subj contact with pain first interestingly
    - Fibers are close enough to trigger first perhaps
    - Pain not always bad: could be investigated further
    - Don’t want to cause subj discomfort
    - Some interaction effects that change threshold of pain fibers
