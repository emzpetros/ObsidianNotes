The y-axis of this graph is the relative cell populations involved in an inflammatory response. The x-axis is the time since the initial tissue injury in days.

The cells are as follows:

- Dark Blue - Neutrophils: These cells are drawn to the injury site from circulation via signaling from the injured area. After exiting blood vessels via diapedesis, neutrophils migrate to the damaged area and begin to phagocytize harmful substances [1]. These are some of the first responses in inflammation and are prominent in the acute phase.
- Red - Macrophages: Macrophages perform a similar role as neutrophils. However, these cells are much larger and more effective at phagocytizing bacteria [1]. The are drawn to tissue via cytokines and also engage with the body’s immune system
- Yellow - Fibroblasts: As inflammation develops fibroblasts gather at the site. These cells contribute to chronic inflammation by generating signaling cytokines that recruit other immune cells like macrophages [3].
- Light Blue - Lymphocytes: As inflammation continues, lymphocytes are recruited as part of the body’s immune response. Depending on the type, these cells allow innate and adaptive immunity to prevent infection [4].

The acute phase of inflammation is in the initial hours after tissue injury into the first couple days. Past 2-4 days as shown in the above figure the inflammation turns chronic. The difference here is in the chronic phase there is less neutrophil activity as macrophages take over [3]. As mentioned before, fibroblasts contribute to chronic inflammation via cell signaling so it the increase in these cells also indicated a transition point from acute to chronic inflammation.

Pharmacological control of blood coagulation through warfarin involves Vitamin K interactions.  Also, newborn babies get an injection of Vitamin K before being sent home. Where is Vitamin K involved in the coagulation process?

  

Vitamin K is involved at several points in the coagulation cascade where coagulation factors are present. The coagulation process in general is a series of reactions amongst coagulation factors that produces a prothrombin activator complex. This substance cleaves prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then cleaves fibrinogen molecules allowing binding between them to produce a web or fibrin fibers that ultimately forms a clot by trapping platelets and other cells [2]. This system works in tandem with anticoagulation processes that maintain coagulation at an effective level without causing unnecessary thrombi [2].

The primary interaction of converting prothrombin to thrombin can be reached via the intrinsic of the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway begins with factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen, and factor XI [3]. The extrinsic starts with tissue factor that is exposed when the blood vessel endothelial surface is disrupted [2]. Both sequences involve a number of coagulation factors with active and inactive forms in order to produce prothrombin activator [3]. These enzymes rely on vitamin K to activate and trigger the subsequent clotting factors. On a molecular level, vitamin K reacts with glutamic acid on these factors to form a modified amino acid, ϒ-carboxyglutamic acid [3]. Because of this change, the factors can bind to metal ions, most notably calcium [3]. Both pathways converge with activated Factor X as the final step leading to the production of thrombin.

Lack of vitamin K would could disrupt this process by preventing activation of factors X, IX, VII, and among other proteins [1]. This interference would affect both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways ultimately hindering coagulation.

Reply:

Hi Roberto, great response. It is interesting to hear about vitamin K’s role in producing anticoagulation proteins as well as factors that lead to coagulation. Ultimately, vitamin K deficiency is associated with lack of coagulation so it seems one of these interactions is stronger than the other.

Inflammation does involve immune cells and is part of a general immune response. However, it is not the same process as the immune response that directly detects detects and eliminates foreign invaders such as bacteria for viruses via cellular and humoral pathways (this reaction may occur in an implant if it is not properly sterilized).

General inflammation consists of, “redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved,” and can be acute or chronic [2]. These effects assist in fighting off infection by drawing additional immune cells to the targeted area of tissue via signaling and increased blood flow to the area [2].

Inflammation can also occur in response to a foreign material in the body instead of a bacterial or viral infection. This reaction can happen with implants like the artificial hip shown in the picture. Called the foreign body response, implanting a device damages tissue and triggers inflammation [1]. Similar to inflammation from an infection, immune cells are directed toward the area. Proteins and eventually larger cells such as neutrophils and macrophages are drawn to and adsorb to the surface of the implanted biomaterial [1]. The implant is large so immune cells will fail to eliminate it via phagocytosis. Instead immune cells release toxic factors to try and degrade the material. Past this stage, the foreign body response becomes chronic and encapsulates the material in a tough fibrous layer. In this way, even if an implant is free of particles that could cause an immune response similar to bacteria or viruses, an inflammatory response still occurs that involves immune cells.

Hi Selvin, I like your point that even if we implant a biocompatible natural material into the body it will still activate an inflammatory response. In addition to treating the materials as you mentioned, it seems that less invasive surgical procedures could potentially lessen inflammation as well. Though I imagine there will always be some level of tissue damage that is unavoidable.

This picture shows how the DNA in human cells is organized. All of the genetic information is contained in 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. The pairs of chromosomes point to how genetic information is passed down from parent to child. Each person ends up with two copies of the same chromosome where one comes from the mother and one from the father. During meiosis these matched pairs undergo duplication and recombination to produce gamete cells with a variation of genetic information from the mother and father (Alberts). DNA packed in chromosomes also has a spatial purpose. Laid out end to end the DNA in the chromosomes takes up much more space (2 meters) than could be contained in the nucleus (6 micrometers in diameter) (Alberts). To fit in this space, DNA folds and condenses into chromatin. This structure is further packaged into chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis during the DNA replication step.

This picture also shows many of the chromosomes bent around a center point. This feature could point to the centromere at the center of each chromosome. This structure plays a role in cell division. To pass on genetic information DNA is first replicated and forms X shaped structures of identical chromosome pairs. Then microtubules attach to each duplicated chromosome at the centromere via the kinetochore protein structure (Alberts). This anchoring allows the chromosomes to line up at the center of the cell in metaphase and be pulled apart during anaphase. As a result, in mitosis each daughter cell has an identical copy of the original DNA. In meiosis, the process is alerted to produce asymmetrical daughter cells but the separation of DNA still utilizes the same mechanism.

Reply: Hi Selvin, thanks for the background on the staining process used to produce this image. I knew about the effects of having more chromosomes or missing some like with Down Syndrome and the other genetic diseases you brought up. Are there corresponding conditions that come from abnormalities in the patterns of the band structure as well?

Phalloides, a family of extremely poisonous mushrooms, are the source of phalloidin, a protein-based probe used to bind to and label actin. Based on this information, discuss why you think this mushroom family is so deadly.

  

  

Actin is a protein that makes up filament structures in cells in muscles and the cell cytoskeleton. The actin components of a cell give it structural stability and allow movement whether for cell locomotion or for cell division (Alberts). In muscles, actin / myosin complexes are the mechanism behind contraction allowing for movement of the entire body on a macro scale.

Actin filament or F-actin is made of smaller actin oligomers which are in turn made of G-actin proteins. To form complex functions actin polymerizes into longer filaments. The resulting filament can shrink and grow as needed by losing or adding more smaller subunits (Alberts). This ability to dissemble is interrupted by phalloidin the protein found in phalloides mushrooms. Specifically, phalloidin interacts with F-actin and and stabilizes it (Vetter). Stabilization is often a good thing, but here it prevents actin filaments from disassembling which impedes cellular function. For example, cells move by extending their mass in one direction, anchoring, and then pulling the rest of the cell forward (Alberts). This process relies on contractile networks of actin fibers that work together to enable cell movement. Furthermore, to change the direction of movement in response to various signals actin fibers dissemble and reform in the target direction. With phalloidin the cell would not be able to break up actin structures and effectively move.

Additionally, phalloidin has been found to specifically affect liver cells by stabilizing actin. The result is cholestasis where bile is prevented from leaving the liver (Feuer). This disease can go on to cause immediate pain and longer term digestion problems among other issues.

Reply: Hi Noa, I liked how your response details how phalloidin affects actin on a molecular level and also what the macro level effects are such as liver damage. It was also interesting to learn about the structural rigidity of phalloidin that makes it suitable for binding to a protein like actin.

These images illustrate how proteins are directed to enter into the nucleus. This process is accomplished with a specific signaling sequence of amino acids called nuclear localization signals (Alberts 2017). Proteins that contain this sequence are allowed through nuclear pores. Without this signal, many molecules cannot pass into the nucleus due to size constraints.

The right image shows the florescent tag is present in the cell cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. In the left, image the opposite is true. In both cases, proteins are produced that contain florescent peptides. The only difference is the final location of the synthesized proteins. In the left image, proteins that reach the nuclear envelope are able to bind with a nuclear import receptor. This receptor can bind to both the localization signal on the target protein as well as to the nuclear pores of the nucleus. Specifically, they bind to the phenylalanine-glycine repeats in the channel of the pores and are able to travel into the nucleus (Alberts 2017). Once the protein is inside, nuclear import receptor undergoes a conformational change by binding with Ran-GTP and exits the pore to bind to a new protein.

The right image demonstrates how important the nuclear localization sequence is for this transport. Without it, proteins are unable to pass through the nuclear pores. Perhaps this protein is larger than 50 nm and is too big to pass through the nuclear pores on its own (Alberts 2017). In this case, a small mutation had a large negative effect. Only one codon and one amino acid in the protein was altered but as a result the protein was unable to reach the correct region of the cell to perform its function.

Hi Noa, great response. I appreciate the background on the SV40 virus and its role in causing cancer. I wonder how much of its effect relies on being in the nucleus. I imagine the virus can still be effective even in the cytosol alone by hijacking protein translation mechanisms. It would be interesting to see if mutating the localization sequence impairs the ability of the virus to cause abnormal cell growth.

Western blotting is a method to transfer proteins onto a solid sheet for further analysis. The probes are antibodies that bind to specific proteins. These antibodies are often labeled to be fluorescent or enzymatically change color.

  

Southern blotting is for identifying specific DNA sequences and uses capillary action to move flouid to membrane

Semi conservative replication maintains one strand of the original DNA and uses it uses it as a template to create a new DNA strand. A conservative model would create an entirely new DNA helix where both strand are made of brand new nucleotides. A dispersive model would have segments of the DNA be made of the original DNA helix and segments made of all new nucleotides.

Is apoptosis good or bad? Discuss how this picture is relevant to a dialogue on apoptosis.

  

Apoptosis like many cellular functions can be both good and bad. When correctly regulated apoptosis is a valuable tool, but abnormalities can cause a myriad of issues.  
One example of apoptosis functioning correctly is in the immune system. To protect against foreign invaders, lymphocytes are generated with receptors for a multitude of antigens by randomly combing gene fragments (Hall). As a result of this stochastic process, some immune cells will be formed with receptors for a person’s own self-antigens. Left unchecked, these immune cells would go on to target the body’s own tissues. The immune system filters out these harmful lymphocytes and destroys them via apoptosis.  
The above picture is another example of apoptosis being harnessed for regular function. However, in this instance the process was not fully completed. Here, apoptosis is a tool for tissue formation. Typically, all the tissue between a person’s toes would undergo apoptosis and be destroyed. In this case some cells did not correctly self-destruct leaving the 2nd and 3rd toes fused.  
The actual mechanism of apoptosis involves enzymes called caspases that break down proteins to destroy a cell from the inside (Hall). This process can be triggered by external factors interacting with the receptors on the cell membrane or via signals released by mitochondria. The cell is then cleared via phagocytosis. Cells can also die as a result of trauma or toxins and undergo necrosis. Instead of a controlled destruction, cells burst. Inflammation results from the cell interior components spilling out (Alberts). Compares to this outcome, apoptosis is a much better alternative for cell destruction.

Reply:

I came to a similar conclusion that apoptosis is a good process but that under or overregulation can have negative effects. You mention cancer as a possible consequence of abnormal apoptosis. In the Hall textbook I used as a reference it also highlights cancer but with apoptosis as a possible solution if correctly targeted. It’s interesting that the same mechanism could induce or attenuate cancer.

The cell was loaded with a fluorescent protein that changes its fluorescence when it binds cAMP.  Discuss what this means and what has happened.

This figure shows the process of cell signaling in response to an external trigger, in this case serotonin. Here, cyclic AMP or cAMP is the substance of interest for imaging. It proliferates quickly in response to the serotonin.

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is an instance of signaling via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) located in cell membranes. These receptors activate cell processes by activating trimeric GTP-binding-proteins or G proteins. These specialized proteins in their inactive state consist of multiple subunits (alpha, beta, gamma) and GDP bound to the alpha unit (Alberts). When a GPCR is activated by an extracellular signal, it undergoes a conformational change and binds to a G-protein. The activated G-protein also undergoes a conformational change and binds with GTP instead of GDP. Energy from the GTP allows the beta-gamma subunit pair to break apart from the alpha. Both subunits can then go on to activate other enzymes and signaling cascades throughout the cell.

One possible target is adenylyl cyclase which produces cAMP when certain GPCRs are activated. As noted in Alberts, serotonin activates 14 different GCPRs leading to large amounts of cAMP as seen in the figure.

cAMP itself acts as a signaling molecule for further cell functions usually by interfacing with cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase or PKA (Alberts). Similar to G-proteins, PKA has multiple subunits and has an inactive and active state. When activated by cAMP, some subunits break off and go on to trigger more proteins. The ultimate effect on cell behavior depends on the final target protein and can vary from secreting substances to breaking down nutrients (Alberts Table 15-1).

Response:

Hi Ibrahim, great explanation of the cell signaling processes. I liked the context you gave on the multiple effects of serotonin. Because cAMP can trigger a variety of signaling cascades, the same substance affects a myriad of functions. It’s interesting that the all these very different behaviors rely on the same mechanism at the cellular level.

Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) are small molecules that bind to two proteins and bring them together (Corson 2008). The resulting interaction can then trigger cell signaling pathways and result in transcription and protein synthesis. In this case, the end behavior is cell proliferation. Essentially all cell behaviors are controlled by proteins which gives this technique a lot of potential.

The CIDs work similarly to some growth factors by binding to proteins causing dimerization. Dimerization is where two molecules are bound together (Alberts 2017). The molecules could be identical or different. Based on the figure, it appears that two similar receptors are joined. Dimerization can go on to cause a conformational change in the receptors. This action can then cascade into various signaling pathways. As seen in the figure, two different triggers can ultimately feed into the same behavior of cell proliferation.

CIDs are different from growth factors because they are engineered for specific purposes to target certain protein combinations (Corson 2008). As shown in the figure, the nature of CIDs allows them to be administered to cells as needed in order to control their functions.

Another difference from growth factors is that according to the figure, this CID acts within the cell’s cytoplasm. Conversely, growth factor interacts with receptors that penetrate the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid.

Ultimately, this specific use of CIDs seems to take advantage of the fact that the CID could be tuned to match a modified gene. As a result, one could modulate the behavior of only altered cells. This feature may be useful to verify if a modified gene successfully transfers to daughter cells. It could also be utilized in gene therapy. For example, perhaps you could stimulate rapid proliferation of cells with a certain behavior that could compensate for natural cells with impaired functionality.

This factor may be an advantage for CIDs. If the CID has to penetrate the cell membrane it could administered

  

  

Hi Roberto, interesting point about applications of CIDs for cancer therapies. I did not immediately consider that the same signaling for cell growth could also be harnessed for the opposite effect. I imagine the challenge with cancer would be finding a specific feature of those cells that can be utilized to target only them and not cause apoptosis in healthy cells.

Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Kary Mullis, says that he was inspired to invent PCR by his drive up a winding road. Discuss why the winding road might have caused him to think about the various steps in the PCR process.

- Primers coming from both sides
    
    Polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a technique to amplify specific sequences of DNA for further analysis. The process involves first splitting DNA strands at high temperatures. Then primer sequences of DNA bind to their complementary segments on the strands. DNA synthesis occurs when the primed strands are exposed to DNA polymerase and free nucleotides. The polymerase starts at the primers and builds complementary strands of DNA to the template. This process is repeated with cycles of heating and cooling to produce more and more DNA copies (Alberts 2017).  
    Only a specific strand is effectively copied due to the nature of the primers. The primers are designed to bind to each side of the target sequence. Since synthesis occurs in the 5’ to 3’ direction on both separated strands, after two rounds of synthesis the target sequence will be clipped away from the rest of the DNA (Alberts 2017). Further replication then produces exponentially more of the target sequence alone.  
    Dr. Kary Mullis’ conception of PCR while on a winding road may have been related to the way primers surround the target DNA sequence. A winding road almost seems to double back on itself as you drive up it. You end up going back and forth first coming from the right then from the left. Similarly, the primers in PCR trigger PCR in two directions. The road continues forward, so you do not drive over the same area twice, but in PCR the primers border the same stretch of DNA. In this way, the target DNA sequence is separated from the rest and continually copied.

Hi Noa, I liked your observation about the cyclical nature of PCR and the winding road. An incremental process is ultimately more effective for both driving uphill and replicating large amounts of DNA. It really shows the power of exponential growth to start small but end up with a significantly larger population. Cell growth utilizes the same mechanism to form tissues from single cells. It’s interesting to see the same principle show up in a man-made process as well.

DNA replication on Earth is Semi-Conservative (see above). Imagine a world where DNA replication is Fully-Conservative. Discuss what you think this would mean, and based on your theory, draw a chart as above but with what you think the data from your DNA replication plan would look like.

- _You will need to scan the chart and upload it to your discussion thread._

DNA replication follows a semi-conservative model where the new DNA helixes contain one strand of the original parent DNA and one new strand formed during the replication process.   A conservative process of DNA replication would still produce two identical DNA helixes.  However, one would consist of entirely new DNA in both of its strands and the other would be made entirely of the original parent DNA.

Assuming the extensive proofreading of replicated DNA could still take place effectively, a conservative process may reach the same end goal.  However, this alternative seems like it would be less efficient than a semi-conservative process.  Say the process begins as usual by DNA unzipping.  Ultimately, it would not be as simple as attaching new nucleotides to both parent strands.  Perhaps one strand would have new nucleotides added and then the resulting helix would be unzipped again.  The parent strands could be reattached and new nucleotides would complete the remaining strand that was also made from new components.  Or the replication could follow the semi-conservative steps but then the resulting sets could be split and have their strands swapped to make sets of fully original and fully new DNA.

Compared to either of these potential options, semi-conservative replication is able to form two sets of DNA with less steps by simultaneously building directly on both parent strands.

Meselson and Stahl’s experiment for fully conservative replication would look like the following:

Each generation consisting of one old and one new set of DNA.  In G1, one set would have two heavy strands and the other two light strands.  This pattern would continue with every generation having one set that maintains two heavy strands but all others would have 100% light strands.

Reply:

Hi Matthew, I like your point about environmental factors accounting for more mutations since there would be extra steps in the replication process. Perhaps if replication had been fully conservative there would have been additional proofreading methods developed to compensate for the errors. However, any additional mechanism would still reduce the efficiency of the process and introduce even more environmental complexity. It seems the semi-conservative process is a much more advantageous framework.

What does a double membrane mean? The theory is that the double membrane came from a primitive symbiosis between two organisms. Discuss.

A double membrane means that there are two lipid bilayers in the mitochondria. A single membrane is present in something like the cell membrane which consists of a one lipid bilayer separating the interior from the exterior. Mitochondria have two lipid bilayers that create two interior regions. Between the outer and inner membranes is an intermembrane space. And within the inner membrane is the matrix. Transferring substances between these spaces via transport proteins and other complexes enables the mitochondria to produce energy for the cell.

Alberts (2017) describes how mitochondria have their own genetic information and share many characteristics with bacteria (p. 25). The complex structure of the mitochondria is thought to have originally been its own organism that processed oxygen for energy. Alberts (2017) also explains how early eukaryotic cells were likely predators that engulfed other organisms (p. 24). Primitive eukaryotes likely consumed mitochondria in this manner. Instead of cannibalizing the consumed cell, both evolved to function in harmony. Eukaryotic cells were then able to utilize oxygen for energy.

According to Hall (2011), mitochondria can also replicate themselves and contain DNA like that found in the cell nucleus (p. 16). As a separate organism, self-replication would have been necessary for the mitochondria to survive. It continues to play a role if a cell needs more mitochondria to function properly for example in muscle cells with high energy consumption. This capacity for replication independent of mitosis further supports the idea that mitochondria and eukaryotic cells were separate entities in the past.

  

Why is the inner membrane shaped like it is? If important reactions were to happen, where would they be put? Discuss.

The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is made of many folds that increase its surface area to be much larger than that of the outer membrane. Hall (2011) describes the surface of the inner membrane as full of proteins that contribute to the production of energy for the cell (p. 16). These enzymes convert nutrients into _adenosine triphosphate_ or ATP which is utilized to perform cellular functions such as protein synthesis and waste removal. Having a large surface area of the inner membrane means this process can occur in multiple places across the membrane. Ultimately then, the structure of the inner membrane increases the efficacy of the mitochondria.

Within the mitochondrion, important reactions could take place within the intermembrane space, within the matrix, or within the inner or outer membranes. The outer membrane and intermembrane space are unlikely candidates to house important reactions. According to Alberts (2017), the intermembrane space has a composition similar to the cytosol because the outer membrane contains pores to allow substances across and is generally permeable. Therefore, few specialized reactions could take place here beyond what already occurs in the cytosol.

The inner membrane has characteristics that make it more suitable for important reactions. The matrix of the mitochondria is on one side of it. This area has a different composition than the intermembrane space. As described in Hall (2011) this region stores enzymes that specifically part of the process to generate ATP. The inner membrane can therefore transport substances to and from this area to be transformed into useful energy products. The membrane itself also has an abundance of surface area for specialized enzymes to further assist with this process.

Hey Justin, I like the connection you drew between the folded structure of the mitochondrion and the brain. Even though the scales and contexts are drastically different nature developed a similar solution for both. Another area this approach is found is in the small intestine where folds increase the surface area and number of villi that can contribute to absorption of nutrients. I also agree with your conclusion that the folding likely developed because it produced a quantitative advantage. Whatever the context, having more space for beneficial structures or interactions would be favorable.

I am a first year in the PhD program and will be working with Dr. Hamid Charkhkar in the ReLLiNC Lab at the VA. We work on sensory restoration for lower limb amputees. My specific interest is in using virtual reality technology in the field as a research tool and / or a clinical intervention.

I had been interested in biomedical engineering since reading about advanced prostheses in Nat Geo and being impressed by the possibilities. The technology was truly on the cutting edge and was having immense impact in people’s lives. In undergrad, I discovered I also enjoyed my computer science courses. I was able to combine my interests by choosing a computing track in BME and also using platforms ands tools from computer science in my BME research.

In this class, I am looking forward to being a more well-rounded biomedical engineer by improving my knowledge of biology.
