**Final Paper Prompt**

**Paper option:** a 12 – 15 page research paper: this can focus on anything related to the readings and issues of the course. For instance:

- Comics history
- Comparison of works or artists
- Close reading of a work or works
- Superheroes
- Comics as memoir
- Comics as reportage
- And so on

Note that these examples are broad suggestions – your papers should focus more narrowly. And don't limit yourself to these choices - I'm happy if you come up with an idea that's totally different. Also - you're not limited to writing about works that we've discussed in class -- feel free to write about whatever work/works you're interested in.

Your paper should use examples/allusions to make your points. If you’re referencing works we haven’t covered in class (or that aren’t in Best American), please provide illustrations.

**Graphic story option:**

Your graphic story should be 8 – 10 pp., and be accompanied by a critical introduction (4 - 5 pp.) that contextualizes your work in some way. The critical introduction might touch on one or more of the following:

- Your creative process
- Influences on your story (artists/writers whose style you were influenced by)
- Historical or genre context (where do you place your comic in the greater scheme of things)
- Critical context (use the critical readings we’ve done – McCloud, etc. – to talk about your comic)

Keep in mind that you’re not being graded on your art – rather on how you use the techniques and methods we’ve discussed in class in your comic.
