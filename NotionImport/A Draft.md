Our lab’s work has shown plantar sensation influencing high level cortical circuitries with motor adaptation [Kim] and phantom limb perception but we have not examined the mechanism behind this relationship [Charkhkar].

but we have not examined this relationship in detail.

. We have not examined this relationship in detail, but work with dual-task studies In this aim we will explore this relationship in detail and quantify the effect on brain activity.

Locomotion requires a level of attention as shown in dual-task studies [Yogev].

Gait induces cognitive load  
Prefrontal cortex is associated with this load  
Model without CNS defects

Previous work has identified the prefrontal cortex as an area relevant to plantar sensation in impaired populations [Clark]. In this aim we will apply similar techniques to investigate cortical activity due to the absence and presence of plantar sensation in individuals with  
This aim will investigate the mechanism behind this relationship in and examine how cortical areas are affected by plantar sensation  
The prefrontal cortex area is associated with plantar sensation during walking [Clark].

With sensation, the participant receives sensory input about the state of their prosthesis.

Better confidence  
Better recovery from obstacles on same side  
New strategies for obstacle avoidance  
Rely on it better

Engine. The task would consist of walking in a crowded store and avoiding other people while attempting to locate items on your shopping list. The user would be presented with obstacles such as virtual avatars cutting in front of them. Immersed in the virtual world, the subject would seek to avoid the virtual objects as if they posed a true threat, but any “collisions” would be harmless. Thus, a virtual environment enables the creation of situations that significantly tax motor planning while remaining safe. Additionally, significant features of the simulation would be modifiable such as crowd density, movement speed of the avatars, and direction of their approach. Metrics such as the number of collisions, pathing through the environment, and time to complete simultaneous tasks would also be collected in the virtual environment. With plantar sensation, I expect that obstacle avoidance strategies will be more effective resulting in fewer collisions and increased navigation speed

Add more on lab experience, similar projects, resources / facilities available

Consider breaking up collisions between static + dynamic, objs + people

- EEG recording protocol is different between participants: how does a participant’s hair or head shape effect electrode placement or signal integrity?
- Color/shape of environment affecting participants’ ability in aim 2.

Problems + mitigations for Aim 1

Clearly establish benchmarks for success

Focus intro better, methods may have to many details

- Less focus on C-FINE, more on plantar sensation + motor planning

This study will be led by Eileen Petros, a PhD student in biomedical engineering. Eileen has extensive experience programming in the software that would run the proposed VR experiment. Having studied biomedical engineering and computer science, she is uniquely equipped to implement a novel VR task in biomedical research. The experiments described here will take place at the Motion Studies Lab in the Cleveland Louis Stokes VA Medical Center. This space features a walkway with Vicon motion capture and an instrumented treadmill system. Additionally, our lab has a VIVE Pro 2 headset system capable of running the VR task.
