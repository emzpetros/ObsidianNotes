[[EBME 436 Notes]]

- [ ] Week 3 lectures
- [ ] Week 4 lectures

  

We were expected to watch 3hours of lecture / week, read 3-5 chapters of a dense textbook, and apply this all to a technical modeling project. The content itself was useful but not crammed into essentially one month. There was not enough time to do research, take other classes, and properly learn this course's content. This class should be an entire semester. Then there would be time to fully understand the course content.

Finally, little guidance was given on the modeling homework assignment especially for students unfamiliar with complex MATLAB coding. Having some basic resources available would have helped immensely.

It became more stressful trying to complete the modeling assignment in the last few weeks classes than it was helpful. Some of the discussed assignments about extending the model to learn about modeling other parts of a bioelectric cell sounded interesting and useful. I would have loved to get to that point but because of disorganization and lack of team we did not even get close to that.

I am tired of professor using pre recorded lectures to avoid teaching. I took a different asynchronous class this semester where the experience was much better because the professor made herself available via office hours regularly and even gave extra time during project work time. While this is maybe above and beyond I know this prof was teaching several other large grad and undergrad classes. She made the time and I learned more because of that. Having the professor show up only half the time in an already truncated course is unacceptable. Learning via videos is not going to work for everyone. Putting the material into context in class and reinforcing it is an essential aspect of learning. Only showing up to discuss the minutiae of the lectures was so unhelpful as to be detrimental to my learning because it was a waste of time. Perhaps if the class was an entire semester there would be time for these discussions. As is they do not offer any value to BME students trying to learn the details of neuromuscular physiology and modeling.

Dr. Tyler can teach, he does it well in the video lectures! He is clearly passionate about the subject. But he needs to be present in the classroom as well

Another note on disorganization, the TA was not added to the Canvas page until 2 weeks into the already short class (even though it was a half semester class we didn't start meeting at all until after a couple additional weeks).

Finally, in another sign of disconnect, the prof would often assume students had a Case background and had already been exposed to various concepts and tools which could not be further from the truth. This alienates the students and also makes it harder for them to learn when they lack the foundation to grasp more advanced concepts.

The disorganization was also very stressful since we didn't know if we would be getting more assignments toward the end of the semester. It is not fair to the students to leave them in limbo about the overall assignments and course materials.

Please please please make this class an entire semester. The content is important and its a shame there wasn't more time to learn it.

Also accommodate the students effectively. Whether that's with learning styles (a LOT of people do better in the classroom than watching videos), not assuming prerequisite knowledge, and respecting our time and other commitments enough to design a course with clear expectations and reasonable workload.
