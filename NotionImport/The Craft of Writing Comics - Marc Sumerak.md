What does a comic writer actually do?

Story comes first: assuming artist + writer are separate

- Craft story + describe so author can draw it
- Need to be visual thinker, understanding of characters + history (authentic, people will instantly know if it’s off)
- Translate panel in mind to an artist

Editor

- manager, hires, deadlines, QA: production, pairing talent
- Steer story direction
- Blame goes to them when things go wrong
- Guardian of characters + legacy

What are comics: word + pictures used together to tell a story (doesn’t always require both elements)

- Active form of reading, all genres + styles
- iconic characters + imagery
- Just a different delivery method of telling stories: depiction instead of description
- Collaborative art form

Elements

- Issue = chapter of larger story (monthly) vs graphic novels, one-shots, anthologies, web comics
    - Serialized fiction: self contained satisfying story but also tease more to come
- Page: ~22 / issue
    - composed of panel moments
    - Each page stand alone - Mark: actions within single page should feel complete even if part of a large scene
    - Should advance something: plot, action, character - little space
- Panel
    - 1-9 / page, ~ paragraph, each a single moment in time
    - Action, thought, or combo
    - Economy of storytelling: each panel has a job, too much or too little is bad
    - Aim for 5 early: more likely to overfill early on

Choosing moment, frame (staging, angle, view); comes from writer and artist), image (style, mostly artist; artist can influence via script), word (may need less or more depending on the art), flow( how page layout goes)

Clarity: be as clear as possible: what’s happening + how to read

Intensity: make comic jump off page

  

Gutter

- separates + connects action: imagination takes over!
- Time and motion occurs
- Artist expresses _transition_ and reader fills in

  

Transitions: moment to moment, action to action, subj to subj, scene to scene, aspect to aspect, non sequitur

- 65% action to action, subj to subj 20%, 15% scene to scene

  

Making Comics - Marc’s Process

idea —> words —>

Everyone has own process

Story breakdown (plot)

- Synopsis: no more than a page, few paragraphs, broad ideas, overall makes sense
- What you send to editors, here’s the story
- Makes sure you have an ending in mind

Page breakdown Ex: spider man swinging through city

- how will the story play at page by page
- Does it fit in issue
- work on pacing, action, distribution of info
    - Double page spread has to start on even numbered page
- one paragraph / page

Panel breakdown

- smaller scale of pacing + action
- Make sure key moments get proper attention + space
- one sentence per panel: “hulk jumps out of plane” “burce banner standing in airlock”

Full script:

- Artist info: action, setting, tone, emotion
- All dialogue + narration / sound effects
- consider space for dialogue w/ the image

Layouts (thumbnails)

- rough design for page, does action read clearly + all important elements are there

Full pencils: digital or pencil + paper

- Full detail + unique style
- Harder to make changes
- In between final art + thumbnail

Inks:

- Replace pencil line w/ solid black ink line
- More than tracing!
- varied weights, techniques to add depth and texture, enhancing art
- Historically, printing plates couldn’t reproduce line art so inking had to be done
    - Not enough time for one artist to draw + ink
- Became an art process not just production process
- Kirby: F4 vs Thor run; inkers cutting corners

Lettering + Coloring : happen together on the digitally scanned inked page

- Dialogue + sound effects
- Can remedy flow issues by guiding the eye
- Shouldn’t notice good lettering

Coloring: primarily digital now

- Many styles
- Set mood of scene + add effects not possible in B7W

Compositing

- Combine color + lettering
- check for errors

  

Q: breaking into comics now ?

- Different, more mainstream + more competition to get in the door

Marvel no longer taking unsolicited story ideas

- Make your own comics
- Shows what you can do

How long?

- 3 months: staggered production

  

Must reads now

- Saga: space opera
- X-men Hickman
- Horror comics: house of slaughter
- DC Batman line
