Notes

Past work has highlighted  
The integration of peripheral information into the central nervous system is worth exploring for several reasons  
Finally, rehabilitation efforts currently emphasize strength and

Additionally,

Previous work has demonstrated a link between plantar sensation and gait and balance [Ellis]. There is also evidence that peripheral plantar information affects higher neural circuitries

There is a need for more effective rehabilitation tools for individuals with compromised plantar sensation.

Restoring plantar sensation via sensory substation or directly with a neural interface is a promising field. However, in its current form the technology is either non-intuitive as is the case with substation or prohibitively invasive for neural techniques. Until these methods are improved, traditional rehabilitation through physical therapy (PT) is the primary treatment for this problem.

PT has many benefits by encouraging exercise. It directly improves balance and mobility by training muscles and reflexes even in the absence of plantar sensation. Furthermore, by improving confidence in mobility it can prevent isolation from individuals opting out of social activities. PT has limited effects on cortical processes besides benefits because of exercise itself. An understanding of the cortical processes that utilize plantar sensation opens this aspect of rehabilitation. For example, with a link between plantar sensation and motor learning, patients could be taught to use other senses to supplement their motor learning pathways. This adjustment could speed their rehabilitation. As a result, falls could be reduced, and quality of life improved for these populations.

Increased fall risk and higher physical and mental cost to walking can have widespread effects. Individuals may not be able to participate in activities they used to enjoy and spend less time outside the house. In this way, reduced plantar sensation can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Regardless of the cause of the compromised sensation, the consequences to mobility and quality of life are serious.
