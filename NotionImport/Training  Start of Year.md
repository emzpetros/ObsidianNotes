Hi everyone, my name is Eileen Petros and I am an incoming graduate student in the biomedical engineering department. I graduated from CWRU undergrad this past spring, and enjoyed my time so much that I decided to stick around!

As exciting as this time is, I know from experience it can also be intimidating. Luckily CWRU has tons of resources and one unique one is the Case School of Engineering Peer Advisors.

Our group is made up of upperclassmen students across nearly every engineering discipline. Whether it’s choosing your classes or choosing your career path we are here to advise. Our members have experience with co-ops, double-majoring, post-grad planning, and everything in between. Most importantly, we offer a student perspective from peers who have been through the same challenges you may be facing.

Our office is in Nord 316 at the bottom of the atrium staircase. Feel free to stop by with any questions and keep an eye out for events we host around campus!

Finally, I want to wish everyone good luck as you begin your time here. Looking back at the past four years of undergrad, I can say I have made mistakes, made friends, and made memories. The experience has been nothing short of life changing. All of you have much to look forward to. Enjoy the rest of Discover Week and the weeks to come!

  

- Something engaging / energizing
- Role is, walk-in office
- What we do: scheduling, major minor scheduling, career advice, BSMS, study abroad, post-grad, campus resources
    - Student perspective, domain specific (we know the majors)
- Flexible appointments, virtual option
- Been in your shoes before, you’re going to have a lot of questions
- Events: scheduling party
- Excited about it!
