Publication date: 04/01/1989
Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: |-
  Verify / look for astroop in pitch, loudness, time
  Effect of stroop stimuli in L or R ear
Materials: |-
  Words presented in congruent, neutral, and incongruent fashion wrt pitch, loudness, time
  Non stroop stimuli as well of unrelated words
Methods: |-
  No combo presented consecutively 
  5 sec interstimulus duration
  Subjects entered response with buttons

  ”Respond as quickly and accurately as possible”
  Familiarized just by selecting R or L: stop when” standard deviation of the RT for a preceding series of 12 words was ~50% of the mean RT of the same series of 12 words (Moore, Glasberg, & Shailer, 1984).”
Theory: |-
  Stroop measurements are reliable and stable
  Auditory stroop found with high and low (audio / pitch)
  Exacerbated by word with semantic congruent meaning: responding to gender of voice with labeled “joan” “dave” keys instead of man / girl
  ~ to required to say sky in response to the prompt “red”

  Could probe at L/R differences in processing 
Outcome Measures: "Reaction time, accuracy "
Key Results: |-
  No significant difference between ears
  Accuracy high across the board 
  Sig for congruent and noncongruent pitch and loudness stimuli 

  Congruent RT faster than control words
Conclusions: "Stroop for pitch and for semantically similar words to response labels and for loudness "
