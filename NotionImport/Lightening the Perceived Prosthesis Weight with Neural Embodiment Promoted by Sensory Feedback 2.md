Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: Determine if SNP reduces perceived weight of prosthesis
Summary: "Stim reduced perceived weight by a substantial amount and also seemed to be cognitively integrated (DT) and have increased embodiment "
Materials: Ossur, TIME, Rasp Pi, R, Matlab
Methods: |-
  10 min overground walking: rate heaviness, embodiment
  - Lift prosthesis leg + healthy leg w/ ankle weights
  - add weight till they are perceived as equal  Effect of placing the weight on the foot?  Does it feel heavier just because of the change

  Dual Task: spelling backward

  Intensity discrimination: which of two pulses was stronger 
Theory: |-
  Amputees perceive prosthesis as “uncomfortably” heavy

  Weight perception influenced by many factors: peripheral + cognitive processes

  Transversal intrafascicular multichannel electrodes TIMES

  [30] amputees have more cognitive burden during gait
Outcome Measures: "Walking speed, accuracy "
Key Results: |-
  Walking w/o stim had no effect on WP
  Walking w/ stim had sig dif in perception for 3 dif weight levels

  No stim = sig decrease in speed
  Higher speed with mental load and SF on vs NF
Conclusions: |-
  Able to differentiate high + low forces

  Lightening may lead to more usable and integration
