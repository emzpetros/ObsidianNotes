Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: "Compare AStroop + VStroop to see how the addition of a structural interference task (Vstroop) affects DT performance "
Materials: "13 healthy, no official cognitive assessment performed "
Methods: |-
  VStroop: 5 color words in incongruent or congruent colors
  - Response as quickly + accurately as possible

  AStroop: same setup, two pitches (described only as high or low)

  1 second duration 

  Obstacle Crossing: 7m long, step over obstacle 30% of lower leg length
  - Used to time cognitive task to right before obstacle

  10 single task obstacle trials

  2 test blocks
  - 20 cognitive seated, 1 cue / 30sec
  - 20 cognitive + obstacle DT
  - Blocks had either A or VStroop, order randomized between subjs

  Instructed not to prioritize one over the other
Theory: |-
  Cognitive tasks vary in
  - Perceptual mech: how subj perceives stimuli
  - Central cog process: match stimuli with correct response
  - Response output: to perceived info

  V + AStroop: differ in perceptual mech only
  - Vstroop for an obstacle course has structural interference, both utilizing visual input
Outcome Measures: |-
  Single Task Stroop: % of correct AND response time
  DTC = DT - ST / ST
Key Results: |-
  AStroop sig worse in accuracy + time from VStroop alonge
  Same for with obstacle
  - Auditory inputs harder to identify at cognitive level
  No DTC effects in cognitive measures

  Larger DTC in gait for VStroop vs AStroop
  Cleared obstacles slower and with more clearance
  - consistent w/ occluded vision studies 
Conclusions: Cognitive task selection is critical
Future work suggested: Eye tracking!
Critiques: "Prioritization makes it hard to compare betwixt studies "
