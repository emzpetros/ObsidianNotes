# Peer Review

- 2-3 reviewers for each application package (each reads 10-20)
    - Make it easy for reviewer
- Accomplishment Page: highlight important things here
- NSF: applicant, intellectual merit, broader impacts
    - Rate 0-50: 40-50 funding, 30-40 honorable mention
    - All gets averaged

# MF Feedback

The personal statement features an impressive amount of prior work, but you might consider proportioning more of the statement to describe your planned training objectives and how they will help you gain expertise needed to achieve your career goals.

  

  

One way to think about the personal statement is that it should explain what your goal is, what you lack to achieve the goal, and how you will gain what you lack during your PhD. It’s totally fine to say that you lack neuroscience foundations (they don’t teach that in CS or BME) as long as you detail how you will gain that expertise through either coursework or research activities. Your prior experience should be used to provide evidence that you have been productive in related efforts or initial steps so reviewers can be confident in your ability to follow through.

I recommended the following outline for a student on my team who was awarded the GRFP last year.

- Career goal and PhD training objectives (list specific expertise to be gained, activities that build this expertise, and how your research plan fits in)
- Academic background (what you have done to prepare for the proposed activities)
    - Describe how the GRFP will enable you to bridge gaps in expertise that separate you from your career goal
- Preliminary work that has prepared you for each of the objectives (prior research, education, volunteer work)
- Intellectual resources and training environment that will enable you to achieve the objectives
- Intellectual merit (how your goal and these objectives will transform the field)
- Broader impacts (how planned research and education/outreach activities will benefit people directly and how many people)
    - Preliminary work toward broader impacts
- Closing statement on how your PhD will enable you to challenge the status quo in the field

Your planned coursework, seminars, papers/conferences should go into this the training plan.

# Week 5 Broader Impact

Feedback

- Aims
    - Keep it to 3: not too ambitious, not too overcrowded
    - Don’t depend on one aim succeeding
- Use PS to exhibit your training
    - All documents read together: PS then RS
- Name drop lab / institution

  

PS: how are you changing the world

- Leadership experiences: contributions
- Give context to your experiences, don’t just list stuff off
- S4
    - All mentoring is good
    - Specific plans, names, orgs, numbers **(PA stats ~280 advising sessions, 377 reached outside office)**
- S3:
    - specific stats
- S2: stuff you would like to do
- S1: TAing in future

  

RS: how solving your problem / your work changes the world

- Specific stats, benefits to population , $ impact
- Find biggest area of impact

  

# Week 4:

Questions

- PS intro vs IM section:
    - intro = high level, overall achievement
    - IM = technical background, things you’ve learned, technical training as a result of your experiences
- Aims address obj+ hypothesis
    - Outcomes should address the gap in the area
    - Some kind of validation
    - Different strategies
    - Clear inputs and outputs of each
- Can use figures: explain flow, structures
- Some kind of statistical testing: don’t give them a reason to nitpick
    - Show you know how to evaluate
- Can have a fair amount of technical detail, not too much jargon
    - Keep overall process itself clear

  

Samples

- Prelim work is not necessary but implicitly shows you have the labs support
- S4: drug delivery method
    - Clear connection to objective
    - Does not have to be extremely detailed with detailed background on the rest
    - Show you have a specific plan
- S3: image analysis work
    - Previous work: done by lab or the student
    - Don’t go overboard in explaining background but be clear about specific aims + plans
- S2: intra cortical electrodes
    - own data
    - Reasonably detailed statistical analysis
- S1: gels for drug delivery
    - Figures for each aim: breakdown into steps
    - Engineer, engineer, evaluate (short)

  

Feedback on IM

- PS
    - Specify technical training: approaches, techniques
    - End goals + what you learned, some kind of achievement

  

# Broader Impact

- GirlsWhoCode: prof dev, minority in the field

# Week 3: Intellectual Merit

“innovation” new or different about proposal

## PS

- Examples of research activities, concise description, work as ind. vs team
- What have you learned + achieved along the way that informed decision to pursue grad. studies
    - What aspects of your research area could you have learned via other means
    - Why a particular exp prepared you for grad studies
    - not just about describing what you did; better to have numbers, outcomes, tangible results
        - Past ability to generate tangible outcomes, do you have what it takes to persevere through PhD
- Outcomes: manuscripts under prep review, presentations etc
- Be specific

S4

- Can break it down by experience or have one flow
- Start with first exp, technical details + skills learned, what was the outcome - manuscript + poster (manuscript under prep, Intersections)
- Story: success then encountered an issue: can problem solve + overcome challenges
- 3rd project:
    - Can say the impact factor of journal, reviewers don’t know every journal
- Also telling some story of their undergraduate career
- Accumulated awards, can list advisors
- Again talked about unique challenges
- Experience in teaching, mentorship (TA, OL, Peer Advisor)

S3

- provided some information on broader impact + context for importance of their work
- Why it’s novel and important

S2

- Defines research area
- How have their varied experiences
- What can it change
- Make specific contributions clear
- Specific tools used : technical term + explanation of it
    - Shows you know your stuff + can communicate it in a non-jargon way
- Even without publication: what impact did it have, (e**xperimental protocol developmen**t)
    - Acknowledgment in publication
    - Presented at multiple posters / conferences
- Why research is important, here’s the work I’ve done in the space
- Drill why you are already making progress on the project: experience to hit the ground running
    - **Highlight current experiment work + data collection**

S1

- Breaking down by different experiences
- Lab work, project —> outcomes
- Skills: **programming, computer science, financing / fundraising/ pitching, communication, teamwork**

  

## RS

General: about what you plan to do vs your experiences ^

- Novelty of the project: what are they doing today, is it new in your domain
    - **Role of sensation in locomotion is not as well understood**
- Clarity is key - limited space 3-5 lines
    - ==One key line== that makes that crystal clear
- How is this pushing the boundary, won’t be something completely new
    - Context, not just what you’re doing
    - **VR approach, new impact of the SNP**

S4

- Bold, underline: clear title IM section
- Key line in bold: “based on lit, new way to treat infection + inflammation”
- why they are best + have resources to complete project
    - **CS + BME**

S3

- Novel aspects + why it’s important (context)

S2

- Secondary impact first to give context, then hit home primary innovation

S1

- Project requires experience in these areas and I have it
- Secondarily implies this is the first approach combining these areas
- Do talk about unique resources: **our lab uniquely has the SNP**
- Best suited bc of access to resources + experiences

  

## Feedback on Openers

- Don’t get too detailed in narrative, don’t have to explain all motivations; show what you did, achieved, learned, takeaways
- Logistics of being here then there, working with this prof is less important than the skills you gained
- RS: reduce amount of jargon

  

## HW

- Add on to the current doc
- Highlight achievements at the top
- Big high level up front, then go into details in IM for PS
- Approach for RS: bullets
