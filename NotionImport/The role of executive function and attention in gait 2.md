Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: Explore role of executive fxn and attention in gait (normal, aged, diseases); role of “higher-level cognitive input”
Key Results: |-
  Studies support a relationship between gait and concurrent tasks that suggested gait requires use of EF and attention
  Dual tasking can probe at this but variability in task choice + prioritization remains an issue

# Executive Function

High level processes taking cortical sensory info in AP brain to modulate + produce behavior

Needed for goal-directed actions + managing attention

Components: volition, planning, purposive action, effective performance (action monitoring) [cognitive inhibition]

## Normal EF

Frontal lobe + networks: anterior = self-regulation, dorsal = reasoning

Frontal lobe is important part but other areas are also active

## Aging

EF susceptible to white matter lesions: high variability, not a drastic level of decline

EF should be evaluated with neuropsychological tasks AND ADL (grocery shopping, meal prep)

## EF and Gait Measures

Trail Making Test: A - draw line connecting consecutive # 1-25, B - connect alternating letters and #

- Poor TMR performance matched w/ decreased gait speed in obstacle course

Several studies found relationship: stronger with more challenging locomotor tasks or w/ populations w/ abnormal gaits _amputees!_

**Only correlation, more detailed measures needed**

  

# Attention

No clear definition

Focus on divided attention: use in multi-tasking, relevant for fall risk + walking

## Dual Tasking Models

Challenges attention capacity: if gait is automatic then task + walking should not effect either individual task’s performance

### Theory

Capacity-sharing:

- Limited resources, multiple attention-demanding tasks will lead to reduced performance in at least one
- Assumes you can prioritize capacity to a specific task, even largely automatic ones (walking)

Bottleneck

- Tasks that use same neural processing will have to be done sequentially causing a delay in reaction time
- Stage of overlap not known
- Neural networks within dual tasks need to overlap to see an effect

Multiple resource

- Processing needs an amount of resources
- Therefore, dual tasks interference relies on the dual tasks using same resources; cognitive + walking might not be an issue

Cross-talk

- If tasks are from same “domain” + use same neurons there won’t be interference

## DT in Different Populations

Healthy

- Generally reduction in speed, sometimes also in task performance
- Gait variability not affected
- No effect explanations: low difficulty cognitive task, prioritization given to gait
- Non-zero cost

Older

- Older studies found increase in reaction time or less gait speed
- Recent studies found DT causes slower walking, no change to variability; may be some worse performance in cognitive task
- A couple found variability changes

Neurological Disease

- Parkinson’s, Alzheimers: deficit in EF and altered gait patterns
    - Slower stride, speed, more double support time, increased stride-to-stride variability
- Study relating ability to walk + talk to less falling [76]

  

## Prioritization

Prefrontal cortex + anterior cingulate cortex active during dual task

Healthy: tendency to prioritize gait

Patient populations + older adults: “posture second”, sometimes manifests as better task performance in DT compared to controls

Explicit instructions —> reduced DT cost in task of focus

  

## Methodology

Issues

- Prioritization varies or is not specified
- Cognitive task varies
- No way to quantify level of attention loading

Task Choice

- Difficult but not stress inducing
- Not be affected by individual skill i.e. math, verbal fluency
    - Could adjust to each person
- Difficulty over time

# Clinical Implications

Can use assessment tools for EF evaluation (originally for neurological patient populations not for healthy)

## Possible Treatments

Train task separately or together: benefits to doing together

Some initial signs that training can improve walking, another aspect to work at is prioritization

Improve cognitive function: transfer to non walking tasks shown, yet to be tested with gait

Drugs: methylphenidate, may have a general cognitive benefit or relate to dopamine levels

  

# Final Thoughts

relationships betwixt cognitive fxn and gait (gait changes as a predictor for dementia development and regular walking as a deterrent)

Explainable if gait requires EF + attention

Appears to be substantial evidence for a relationship betwixt EF and gait changes though not causally proven

“This dependence is most notable in patient populations where the ability to compensate for an  
impaired gait is restricted to due a lack of “cognitive reserve.”
