Vera Brosgol: “Welcome to O.R.R.A“

“Welcome to O.R.R.A” is an excerpt from _Be Prepared_ by Vera Brosgol. Brosgol was born in Moscow in 1984 and moved the United States when she was 5. Trained in classical animation, she has worked on storyboards for films such as _Coraline_ and _Paranorman_ before working full time on comics and children’s books. _Be Prepared_ draws from her own life experience growing up in a new country.

One element of this piece that stood out to me was the expressive eyes on the characters that I found effectively conveyed their emotions. The color palette is also notable with one review describing it as “That shade of green being the perfect ‘outsider’ color, capturing the outdoors milieu as well as the feelings Vera experiences at camp” ([https://www.tcj.com/reviews/be-prepared/](https://www.tcj.com/reviews/be-prepared/)).

Brosgol’s graphic novel debut in 2011 was _Anya’s Ghost_ which won an Eisner, Cyblis, and Harvey Award. Several short comics projects of hers are available to read on her website ([https://www.verabee.com/](https://www.verabee.com/)) including an hourly comics exercise where since 2012 she has made a comic for every hour of one day ([https://www.verabee.com/hourly-comics](https://www.verabee.com/hourly-comics)). She describes her style as emphasizing clarity and trying to communicate in a simple manner. You can see this style develop in her hourly comics as she starts using a brush and ink.

Brosgol also describes her process of making a graphic novel on her website ([https://www.verabee.com/news/2011/06/process](https://www.verabee.com/news/2011/06/process)). She begins working from thumbnails and finds that dialogue comes with the visuals. To produce a finished comic page she sketches it out digitally and inks over it using translucent vellum. The finished page is scanned and lettering is done digitally.

“Vera Brosgol was born in Moscow, Russia in 1984 and moved to the United States when she was five. She received a diploma in Classical Animation from Sheridan College, and spent many years working in feature animation but now she is writing and drawing books full-time. She likes that very much.

She has storyboarded for Laika on the feature films _Coraline_, _Paranorman_, _The Boxtrolls_, and _Kubo and the Two Strings,_ as well as for Cartoon Network, Frederator and various commercial projects.

Her first graphic novel, Anya's Ghost, was published in 2011 by First Second Books and won an Eisner Award. Her first picture book, Leave Me Alone, was published in 2016 by Roaring Brook Press and won a Caldecott Honor.

She lives in Portland, OR, and loves knitting, riding her bike, and trying not to kill her plants.  She hopes you are enjoying looking at her drawings.”

“Vera Brosgol is the author of the 2017 Caldecott Honor picture book _Leave Me Alone!_, as well as the Eisner, Cybils, and Harvey Award-winning graphic novel _Anya’s Ghost_. Her latest book is the picture book _Memory Jars_.

Born in Moscow, Russia in 1984, Vera immigrated to the United States with her family in 1989. A voracious reader and obsessive artist, Vera did not consider making books to be a viable job (possibly because she’d never had an author visit!). Instead she began her career in animation, studying Classical Animation at Sheridan College and working for a decade at Laika Inc. as a storyboard artist on films including _Coraline, The Boxtrolls, Paranorman_, and _Kubo and the Two Strings_. In 2016 she made the leap to being a full-time author and couldn’t be happier.

A West Coast transplant, she spends her days in beautiful Portland, OR with her chihuahua Omar. When she’s not writing and illustrating, she’s busy riding her bike, doing yoga, baking sourdough bread, and knitting embarrassing sweaters for little Omar.”
