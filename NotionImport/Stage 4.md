Group 1 go on Thursday

Attednace: Missing Liam , levant

Feedback: missing chibidum, Thomas shik

  

  

Team 6

What about camera clipping

Multiple endings

Different pass cofe types

More playtest feedback

Giving too much hints

  

Why change to first person : deal with camera angles

uI scaling : make presentation version

Can you see your reflection in the mirror

Sound effects on the opening objects? Collecting items?

  

Ending only based on last decision

Puzzle design!

  

Maybe make inreractabel bjects pop more : base on time , number of times players walk by

  

Build Comments

- There are still several typos in the dialogue
- Lock on icon on the cabinet helps a lot!
- Being able to move backwards when you press S instead of it causing you to turn would help navigation a lot
- Overall puzzle design and gameplay is excellent, especially for a 3D game!

  

Team 3

Steering adjustment: coins, larger asteroids, fixed cheat

Pie chart

Player prefs for remembering sound

  

Timer turns red, hold E

Steering game inactive

  

What do you do with money

Don't trust peopl to read: task based

  

Change engine to task not constant

  

Money just score

Randomly choosing tasks

  

Progress bad to destination vs time

Consequences for tasks: have asteroids hit you anyway, engine blow up

Money buy repairs?

  

Make room smaller

  

Random spawns

Feedback from Class

- Main criticism is improving / integrating the incentives to play the mini games with either the timer / ship progress and / or the coins

Build Comments

- I would make the engine dial UI slightly larger
- Better alert for ship steering minigame so you know it needs attention even off screen
- Thoughts on the incentive issue:
    - Maybe have money be usable to buy repairs? so you have an incentive to play the steering game and earn more coins
    - Or have the consequence for the steering game be similar to the engine in that it stops your progress
    

  

  

Team 5

Attacking fixed

High score tracking

Progress bad almost done

  

Overlay for UI for , bigger text

  

Vary pitch of sounds or one or two

  

+1 visual indicator, larger score values

  

Adding feedback for cool down

Set start point that ties into story

  

Enemies spawning from outside the ring then dying

Activate enemies as you go

  

Build Comments

- Game is a lot of fun!!
- Adding higher numbers to your score would definitely increase the arcade feel
- If the sound effects get too repetitive consider varying the pitch slightly
- Adding feedback for the attack cooldown would help a lot

  

Team 1

Playtesting

Flashing indicator

Timer resetting between playthroughs

2 rounds

High score saving

  

Comments from Class

Build Comments

- Timer bug: player control stops switching after a minute or so has passed?
- Can still move player after losing / winning round
- Could be helpful to have UI indicator to direct player to item pedestal
    - As is thereâ€™s almost an information imbalance, the red player always knows where to take the items but the green one has to figure out where the items belong
- Spy v Spy game: split screen
- 2 cameras: culling mask for each

Team 4

Overlays on the UI

Replayability tasks

  

Alerts for the human and tasks

  

Progress bar for mouse?

How do you do better ? With constant time

- Score multipliers

Knowing how to go for the door at the end

  

Sound effects!

Alert for key

  

Build Feedback

- Sound effects for mini games, cat actions, and key pick up would add a lot to the game
- It is not obvious that you have to go out the door at the end, some kind of alert or pop up would be helpful
- Like the idea of score multipliers to give the player additional feedback

  

  

Team 2

Love the ui updates

White text a bit hard to read on the light blue

Long part of tongue catches flies too

  

Double jump: how much is it actually used

  

Lives? Pac man style , reset the level

  

Implementing level select

Class Feedback

- Move UI bars close together
- General approval for the idea of adding lives so you can restart the current level you are on

  

Build Comments

- Particle effect on invincibility is very nice
- Difficulty curve is much better: made it to L3!
- Currently no music on menu screen
- White text on the light blue background is still a bit hard to read
