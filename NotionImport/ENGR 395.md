# To Do

- [x] Syllabus draft
- [x] Send out guidelines, establish a deadline, let them know : end of finals
- [x] Get added to Canvas
- [x] Workshop ideas
- [x] Offer to team leads
- [x] Feedback on semester plans
    - Local: great overview of circuits and electric components
    - Local: consider other non fan options
    - Malawi: more concrete goals
    - Congo: missing team members, how many people would be expected to travel (paying for advisors)
    - Motorized Arm: fantastic project, put together a project reflections doc
    - DR: how many people plan to travel
- [x] Task Delegation
- [x] Guidelines on mid-semester reviews and end-of-semester reports. I've been intending to draft the mid-semester review doc for weeks and haven't managed to get it done. Would you take a stab at it? As with the semester plan, it can be derived from the 395 assignment but simplified and framed as a team activity, not a class assignment. I see two components:
- [x] a review of the project plan and progress, including decision making and course correction if needed; and an assessment of the team (e.g. the feedback form followed by a team discussion and decisions/action items as needed).

# 10/7

Mid semester guidelines:

- Team Deliverable: Reflection report, team meets together
    - Task delegation / accountability : team leads + members, is it effective
    - Anything you’re changing/ doing differently going forward
    - Progress on overall project goals
- CATME evaluation
    - Advisors or student leaders - Abby
- Nov 6 Design Review Workshops

1. Task Accountability Plan
2. Plan for verifying that tasks get done
3. Examples: Gantt Chart, progress reports, Slack, agile
4. Report to Abby / Ananya
5. Could be for future plans, incorporate in mid-semester review
    1. How are things going for task management

  

  

# 9/16

Updates

- [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aLzLDfGuInAzDJsHK1AQfHBHjFLPtCybLSYq8ujpkrI/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aLzLDfGuInAzDJsHK1AQfHBHjFLPtCybLSYq8ujpkrI/edit)

Figure out a documentation process for individual work

Would want to be at one or two

- Let them know if they’re wanted as active presenters
- Think about in-person + what can be asynchronous

  

# 9/2 Rollins + Rhoads

Individual Reports:

- Case for technical elective credit: needed support for that, evidence of technical learning + students spent time
- Analogous classes are credit for research: poorly documented
- Defensive documentation

Dr. Rhoads: get rid of hours count

- Typical 3 hrs / credit hours, not documented

  

Check ins

- One after semester plan (wk3) and around midterms

Portfolio

- Key docs need authorship information: expected in academic life

Notebook - whatever progress report turns into

Reflection:

  

How do we help team leads get there?

- Making things detailed makes them less flexible
- Too little instruction means they don’t know where to start
- Execs hold workshop for these things!!!
    - Semester planning:

Set the first one up

- Instructors are willing to help, students should co-lead it
- Use old assignments in workshops
- Document them for reuse
- Build up a library of workshops

  

Semester planning workshop:

  

Brainstorm ideas:

- Jump start it, how to take the first step
- How you might outline it

  

5 workshops a semester: 4 for this semester (need more than 1-2)

- 2 / club
- Advise to semester plan

# Feedback form Leads 9/2

Useful for All:

- Advisor check-ins
- Accountability for semester plans + Gantt chart
- Communication portfolio: needs to be done anyway
- Interviews: not done anywhere else
- Final Design presentation: communicating about a project you care about
- Documentation checks: **keeps leads accountable for keeping teams accountable**
- Design documentation: real life design process, organization
    - Onboarding docs specifically a good refresher

  

New Members: interviewing (repetitive after first time), Gantt chart (sometimes not used by specific team leads), all!

  

Not Useful

- Final reflection: _agreed!_ A team reflection / takeaways would be more useful vs individual
- Individual Progress reports: tedious, better done on a group / team level
    - _issue of individual grades_
- Stakeholder Analysis: good for problems but repetitive to do every time and not that helpful
- None are bad if it reflects real world experience

Improvements

- How to do a design review
- How to to communicate with technical advisors: setting expectations + improving communication skills
    - Professional communication
- Guest lectures!
    - Reduce repetition: _bring in EWB pro chapter people?_

  

Questions:

- For leads will the assignments be the same stuff done in the club itself?
- Still asynchronous?

  

Ideas

- CATME
- Borrow from Game Design Course
    - Mostly self directed: focus was on the work done
