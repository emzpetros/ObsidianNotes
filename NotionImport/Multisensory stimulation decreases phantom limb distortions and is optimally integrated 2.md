Literature Type: Paper
Objective of study: "Evaluate a VR / electro-cutaneous stim framework effect on reaction times and phantom limb distortion, investigate optimal multisensory integration "
Materials: |-
  HTC Vive headset
  Unity3D

  Communication: Pipeline Server, Unity scripts write to server w/ DLL via a “pipe” in TENS control program 
Methods: |-
  Discrimination betwixt vibrating bars, choose faster vibration
  Performed with visual, tactile, and both and a conidition of blurred vision

  Statistical Task: two bars vibrating, front and back of thigh

  Simultaneous Discrimination: stimulation to two different stump locations, measure reaction time

  Waves: waves hitting virtual foot, synch and asynchronous 
  Various questionnaire assessments given [citations]
  Note end of stump and phantom foot
Theory: |-
  Phantom pain + limb distortion may arise from distorted multisensory integration

  Optimal integration theory: weighted estimation of sensory cues, weights = reliability 
  Expected benefit = better sensory info processing: lower discrimination thresholds, faster reaction times; altered body representation
  Subj tend to rely on dominant sensory info i.e. visual

  Compare predicated bimodal value with actual to check optimal integration 

  Subj responses fitted to a distribution using Max Likelihood Estimation to get a curve showing probability of subj saying the given vibration was larger than standard
  Also got a Point of Subj Equality: period of bar when it was judged faster in 50%
  Just Noticeable Difference: smallest detectable difference 
Outcome Measures: |-
  Compute a theoretical ideal integration and compare the actual integration bimodal value
  Verify bimodal thresholds change by manipulating availability of sensor modalities
  Reaction times improved
  More embodiment, less phantom distortion in length and position 
Key Results: |-
  Visual JND << than tactile: vision is more reliable 
  Bimodal JND not sig different from most reliable visual cue + predicted cue
  Blur changes reliability of visual cue: improvement predicted by MLE max with no dominant modality (cues had similar weights)

  Improved reaction time in bimodal

  Improved embodiment and phantom limb length / position in synchronous condition 
Conclusions: |-
  Lower limb amputees shown to optimally integrate visuo-tactile feedback

  Benefits in response time and embodiment 

  Optimal integration can occur when spatial modalities do not align: possible reason = top down factors modulating merging of cues
  Unity assumption: observers belief that cues belong to same obj or even modulates their processing
Future work suggested: |-
  Large sample size
  cannot claim that wave experiment has optimally integrated information 

  Could optimally integrated multisensory stim help with chronic pain?
Critiques: |-
  Noted in paper: electrical stim applied to residuum, NOT spatially matched
  Very small sample size, VR environments differed betwixt subjs
