- “Short-term loss of plantar sensation affects lower-limb kinematics and gait dynamics, particularly during the first half of stance, and contributes to modified muscle-activation patterns during locomotion.” “However, gait dynamics and the ability to decelerate the forward velocity of the centre of mass were not impaired by the reduced plantar afferent feedback. The present findings confirm the impact of further comorbidities of peripheral neuropathy regarding altered gait characteristics and increased plantar pressures in diabetic patients.” [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-012-2364-2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-012-2364-2)

    - Correlating PFC activity with executive function
        - Increased with stress elvels
    - Complex motor activity (obstacles, precision, TUG): cortical activity was task specific
    - **Few linked cortical outcomes + behavioral data: falls, worse gait (sower), stress, fatigue, energy**
    - Suggests targeting “executive-attnetional activity at PFC” could help
    - Recommmendaitons
        - “Use adequately powered sample sizes
        - Use task-appropriate instrumentation with an adequately justified sampling rate and number of channels for relevant outcomes
        - Provide detailed information on ROIs and justify the number and location of channels assigned to each ROI
        - Emphatically report all recorded cortical activity outcomes and provide outcome definitions along with a detailed report of data pre-processing
        - Use standard walking (ideally overground) or balance tasks that can be compared to previous literature
        - Use standard secondary tasks that do not interfere with cortical activity instrumentation measurement (i.e. no talking)
        - Routinely assess relationships between cortical activity and behavioral/cognitive outcomes”
