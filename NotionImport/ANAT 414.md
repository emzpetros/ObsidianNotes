# M1: **Morphology and Development Class**

**Group 1: Describe the earliest phase of CNS development through week 4.** Some of the questions you may address include: What are the primitive node and streak? What germ layer gives rise to the notochord? What is the function of the notochord, what does it secrete and what does it become in adults? What germ layer gives rise to the CNS and what transcription factors must be secreted and suppressed for induction/neuralization to occur? What is the neural plate and groove? What are the anterior and posterior neuropores and when do they close?

The primitive node and streak are the structures of an embryo where neural tissue will being to form. The primitive node is an indentation in the middle of the embryo and the streak develops from it toward the posterior of the embryo (dorsal side). Ectodermal cells exit through the streak to form mesoderm.

==The notochord develops from the axial mesoderm. It functions to induce neuralization in the ectoderm tissue leading to formation of the neural tube (neuralation) by secreting FGF4, fibroblast growth factor.== ==In the adult it becomes the cushioning in vertebrae - Nucleus Pulposus==

==The ectoderm gives rise to the CNS. FGF and Sonic hedge hog need to be secreted, suppress bone morphogenic factor 8.== ==Also Retinoic acid==

==The neural plate is a thickening of ectoderm over the notochord and the groove is an invagination of the plate that will form the neural tube.==

==The anterior neuropore closes at 24/25 days (cranial end). Posterior closes at 26/27.==

**Group 2:  Describe neural crest cells and somites.** Some of the questions you may address include: What are neural crest cells? Where do they come from (including the germ layer)? What do they become in adults? How do they migrate? What are somites? Where do they come from (including germ layer)? What do they segment into in the developing embryo? What do they become in adults?

==Neural crest cells are formed in the ectoderm. As it undergoes neuralization due to the notochord there is a gradient of transcription factors. This leads to the formation of a neural tube as the neural plate begins to curve in on itself. The edges of this neural tube when they close break off as crest cells.==

==In adults these cells form the ganglia of the PNS and ANS as well as melanocytes in skin. Also Schwann cells, satellite, intrinsic eye muscles, meninges.== ==The migrate by following gradients of transcription factors from the more epithelial tissue to mesoderm layer.==

==Somites are areas of mesoderm (swellings) that will develop into CNS corresponding to specific areas / levels of the body. They become sceleratome + dermomyotome which further splits into dermatome and myotome. This becomes the vertebrae (arch + body), skin, and muscles of the body wall.==

**Group 3: Describe neurogenesis.** Some of the questions you may address include: What are the 3 layers that develop in neuroectoderm during neurogenesis? Which one of these layers contains virtually no cells? Which one contains multipotent stem cells? Which one contains immature post-mitotic neurons? What two cell lineages arise from the layer closest to the lumen of the neural tube? What are the 4 cells types that can arise from these 2 cell lineages? What is the cortical plate and how many cell layers does it give rise to? What is an “inside-out sequence of development” as occurs in neurogenesis?

The three layers are ventricular (multipotent stem cells), marginal (no cells), and intermediate (immature postmitotic neurons). Formation in that order but spatially V, I, M.

Close to the lumen of the tube are glial cells and neuronal cells. Glial cells go on to form astrocytes, oglidendrocytes (myelin), + radial glial cells (neuronal migration). Neuronal cells become neurons.

The cortical plate is a structure that forms only in the cortex portion of the neural tube betwixt the intermediate and marginal zones. It forms 6 layers where the 6th is laid down first immediately after the neural plate, I, NP, M. The rest pass through laid down layers in order VI-II. LI is already in the marginal zone.

**Group 4: Describe the dorsal-ventral polarity of the neural tube.** Some of the questions you may address include: What 2 plates develop to help drive dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube? What morphogens are important for driving dorsal-ventral patterning? What non-neural structures (there are 2) secrete these morphogens? What morphogen triggers neurons to differentiate into motor neurons? What morphogen triggers neurons to differentiate into sensory neurons? What are the alar and basal plates and what do they become in the adult spinal cord?

==The roof (BMP, sensory) and floor plates (SHH, motor) develop to form the dorsal-ventral patterning driven by SHH from notochord and BMP from surface ectoderm.==

==The alar and basal plates become the dorsal and ventral horns. They form from uneven cell division and are divided by the sulcus limitans.==

  

**Group 5: Describe the organization of the alar and basal plates in the spinal cord and brainstem.** Some of the questions you may address include: Which plate (alar/basal) gives rise to sensory neurons? Which plate gives rise to motor neurons? How are the alar and basal plates related to each other (positionally) in the spinal cord? How about in the brainstem? What structure “separates” the alar and basal plates from each other? What is the organization of sensory (2-3 types) and motor (2-3 types) neurons within the alar and basal plates in the spinal cord and brainstem?

==Alar plate becomes sensory and basal becomes motor. In the spinal cord the alar plate is in the dorsal area and the basal is ventral. In the BS, alar is medial and basal is lateral. Order in medial to lateral in BS / ventral to dorsal in SC: SE, VE, VA, VA. Lateral movement due to 4th ventricle.== ==Divided by sulcus limitans.==

**Group 6: Describe the brain vesicles, flexures and luminal spaces of the developing neural tube.** Some of the questions you may address include: What are the primary brain vesicles? When are they present during development? What are the secondary brain vesicles? When are they present? What flexures are present with the primary brain vesicles? What flexures are present with the secondary brain vesicles? What do the primary and secondary brain vesicles become in the adult CNS? What does the lumen of each secondary brain vesicle become in adults? What secondary vesicle gives rise to the retina?

==There are 3 primary brain vesicles at 4 weeks of development: rhombencephalon, mesencephalon, prosencephalon. Cervical flexure betwixt SC + Rhom, cephalic flexure at mesencephalon.==

==At 5 weeks, 5 vesicles: myelencephalon, metencephalon, mesencephelon, diencephalon, telencephelon. Same flexures but pontine flexure added at metencephalon.==

==In adult, vesicles become structures + lumen of each becomes ventricles==

==myelencephalon → medulla oblongata==

==4th ventricle, lower==

==metencephalon → pons / cerebellum==

==4th ventricle upper==

==mesencephalon → midbrain==

==cerebral aqueduct (links 3rd + 4th)==

==diencephelon → thalamus, hypothalamus , retina==

==Third ventricle==

==telencephelon → cerebral hemispheres==

==Lateral ventricles==

==4th ventricle connected to subarachnoid space by foramina of Luschka + foramen of Magendie==

**Group 7: Describe neural tube defects.** Some of the questions you may address include: What vitamin is important for preventing neural tube defects? What neural tube defect results from failure of the anterior neuropore to close? What neural tube defect results from failure of the posterior neuropore to close? What structure in the adult is the remnant of the closure of the anterior neuropore? What is spina bifida? What are the different subtypes of spina bifida? Which is the least severe? Which is the most severe?

==Folic acid is important to prevent neural tube defects. Anterior failure = anencephaly , posterior = spina bifida.==

==Closure of anterior neuropore becomes== ==lamina terminalis==

==Spina bifida: missing verebrae arch==

- ==Occulta - least severe==
- ==Cystica - most severe, meningocele (meninges protrude), meningomyelocele (SC in sac)==

**Group 8: Describe the central nervous system.** Some of the questions you may address include: What structures comprise the CNS? What are the different types of cells found in the CNS?
