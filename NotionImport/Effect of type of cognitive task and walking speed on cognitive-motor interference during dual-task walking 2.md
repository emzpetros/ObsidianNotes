Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: Determine effects of walking speeds (slow vs preferred) + cognitive task type on CMI of DT walking
Summary: |-
  CMI varies with cognitive task
  Preferred speed walking, tasks that involve EF + planning increase motor cost
Materials: |-
  electronic mat GaitRite system

  Healthy young adults

  Visuomotor reaction time: red then green flash, press button on green
  Word list generation: list word starting with a letter within 10 sec how to determine which letters are of equal difficulty 
  Serial subtraction: count back by a # from a 2 digit #, record correct responses in 10s presumably correct them if needed
  Vstroop: set of 24 words, correct reponses in 10 s

  Tasks that use resources involved with walking + in common use
Methods: |-
  Single Task: cognitive while sitting and walking at self-selected speed and self-selected slow speed

  Each CT done 3x at each speed

  30 mins between single + DT 

  DT cost: ST - DT / ST *100
  Higher = poor performance on individual task
Theory: |-
  Variation in cognitive tasks

  One task alone may not explain CMI or reveal prioritization preference

  Walking speed: does slowing down benefit the cognitive task

  High cognitive cost tasks indicating prioritization of motor task
Outcome Measures: "Gait speed: cite Al-Yahya as best variable + linked w/ functional outcomes (see cites)"
Key Results: |-
  All tasks resulted in sig slower walking speed: slowest w/ stroop
  Cognitive task performance: worse walking than sitting
  - Cognitive cost greatest with VMRT condition, lowest in stroop

  stroop best to see changes in motor task

  Slow walking: further decreased speed w/ stroop, motor cost sig lower than with preferred speed
  - Cognitive task sig better performance in stroop betwixt slow + preferred 
Conclusions: |-
  Young adults performed worse in cognitive and motor task for all cognitive task types
  - Motor cost highest with stroop

  Preferred speed cognitive cost highest with VMRT: conclusion that it is less challenging and walking prioritized (?)
  - Capacity sharing model
  - WLG and SS had more motor cost than VMRT, highest for stroop
  - Stroop had lowest cognitive cost

  Slow walking: reduced cognitive cost with stroop, increase in motor cost
  - Voluntarily reallocating of resources may have led to more being available for cognitive task
  - slow walking as potentially beneficial
