Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): VR
Objective of study: Can VR sims of challenging postural positions affect spinal excitability of postural muscles aka spinal reflex pathways
Materials: |-
  Richieâ€™s Plank exp:

  H-reflex elicited during
  - standing still, standing with VR, standing on building edge, falling from building (free fall + controlled descent)
Methods: |-
  Healthy participants , no prior VR use
  Quest 2 headsets
  pre-built game experience 
  Told to focus at a 2 m point aka end of plank , reduce gaze distance effect betwixt conditions 
Theory: |-
  VR activating sensorimotor areas (see cites in intro)
  H-reflex shown to modulate down during complex postural tasks
Outcome Measures: "EMG of triceps surae, leg / head accelerometer data , fear of falling "
Key Results: |-
  Decrease in H-reflex during falling of soleus only : - 47% from noVR
  - H-reflex low in start of fall then increased before impact
  No dif in body oscillations
Conclusions: |-
  Visual cues sufficient for neuromuscular system to mimic modulation 
  Visual + vestibular systems affect each other: Importance of visual stream during falling

  Differences in controlled falling suggest more than visual view of falling is at play, maybe a fear response

  Lack of GM muscle, different spinal circuits?, experimental design issue recording from extended leg
Future work suggested: Matching visual and other sensory info to maximize VR effect
