Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Materials: |-
  GRAIL system
  Optic flow matched speed
  Force sensors + vicon
  Kinematics + kinetics calculated w/ Human Body Model
Methods: |-
  19 healthy subjects

  3 mins walking, data recorded in final minute

  Self Paced Algorithms: corrects speed based on position of sub  (marker tracking)j vs middle of belt and subj speed, gain as fxn of position x’’ = P delta x - delta x D x’
  SPp
  SP2p: doubled gain of P and D x’’ = 2(P delta x - delta x D x’)
  SPv: PD control + speed dep multiplication factor x’’ = x’( P delta x - delta x D x’)
Theory: |-
  Treadmill gait dif attributed to lack of visual flow [5], limited belt length, fixed speed

  SP modes
Outcome Measures: |-
  Gait parameters
  Subj rating of comfort, fatigue
Key Results: |-
  FS and SP equally comfortable + resembling normal walking
  SP = more freedom in stride variability 

  SPp = most comfortable 
Conclusions: |+
  Comparable gait patterns
  SP: slight reduction in vars, speed + stride length more variable, some frontal + transversal vars more constant

  Not clinically relevant difs: small mag, within normal variability + measurement error
  Subjectively both reported as similar to overground walking

  SPP and SP2P preferred, SPP most 

  Some learning effects

Future work suggested: Asses SP as an alternative to over ground walking
Critiques: 6 mins of habituation normally advised for fixed speed [17][18]
