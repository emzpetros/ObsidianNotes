Background

- Gait uses higher level cognitive functioning
- Dual task paradigms stress this system with simultaneous tasks
- Role of sensation, informing gait
    - Less focus on gait, amputees reporting more attention on walking
    - Less focus on other tasks
- Hypoth: during dual task walking subjects will walk slower during stroop than during reading
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion
    - Task difficulty: needs more for cognitively intact subjects [https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0894-0](https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0894-0)
    - Similarity of tasks
- Conclusions
    - Further work needed
    - Increased task difficulty
    - Dual motor tasks

Previous dual-task studies reported variable results depending on the choice of cognitive task [ref]. Despite alternating tasks within a trial, there may not have been enough difference between the “read” and “stroop” tasks to significantly impact gait speed with a cognitively intact participant. Similarly, the motor task of treadmill walking was not extremely difficult. The role of sensation may not have been perceivable if the combined tasks did not challenge the participant enough to sacrifice performance in one task or the other. A dual-motor task study could be better suited for this population.

Notes

The incongruent condition had the highest level of cognitive load as demonstrated by the increased reaction time and reduced gait speed. However, the consistent error rates between sets of trials (SNP ON – 10%, SNP OFF – 12%) suggests the task was still difficult despite repeated exposure
