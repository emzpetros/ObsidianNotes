Literature Type: Paper
Objective of study: Procedure to determine dominance of visual vs haptic sensory info
Materials: |-
  Haptics from PHANToM force feedback devices on index and thumb

  Visual stimulus: stereogram with dot noise
Methods: |-
  Maximum Likelihood Estimation used to combine inputs

  Raised ledge and judged height visually and by haptics

  Determine variances with discrimination experiments
Theory: If visual modality is weighted higher than probability density is shifted toward visual estimate and its psychometric function will be shifted so the Point of Subj Equality is closer to the visual height
Outcome Measures: Computed psychometric curves from trials (performance around a threshold)
Key Results: |-
  Nervous system combines visual + haptic info similar to a ML integrator 
  Vision dominates when variance of visual input < that of haptic

Name:
  - "[[Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion]]"
