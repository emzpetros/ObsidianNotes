Literature Type: Review Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task,VR
Objective of study: "“investigate methodological variations that may explain dualtask-related changes in gait performance by addressing the following questions: (a) what is the effect of different cognitive dual tasks on various spatio-temporal gait measures? (b) to what extent is dual-task effect on gait modified by cognitive task domain, participant age,  and cognitive or neurological impairment?”"
Summary: |-
  “Dual-task-related changes in spatio-temporal gait parameters include decreased speed, decreased cadence, decreased stride length, increased stride time, and increased stride time variability”

  ”All confirmed the widely accepted notion that gait control places demand on high cognitive systems”

  ”Finally, standardizing research methodologies, as well as improving their ecological validity, enables better understanding of dual-task-related gait changes in different population and improves, in turn, our understanding of their neural mechanisms and gait control in general.”
Methods: Included studies with self-selected ground walking, gait measured during single + dual task, secondary cognitive task vs motor
Key Results: |-
  Tasks with internal interference vs external seem to disturb gait more
  Overall task interference detectable in gait speed 

  still need for standardization
Critiques: |-
  Heterogeneity: “You’ll also want to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity. Do the studies differ greatly, or only slightly” https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/heterogeneity/
  I^2 higher = more heterogeneity, not all telling the same story

# Methods

## Task Types

Reaction Time: probing processing speed

Discrimination / decision making: selective attention + response inhibition, stroop

Mental tracking: holding info, sustained attention + info processing (serial math fxns?)

Working memory: just holding information

Verbal fluency: “word production spontaneously under specific search conditions”

## Stats + Subgroups

Single summary stat

Compared groups of task types + patient populations

Meta-regression to investigate age and CMI effect on gait + cognitive state to gait

# Results

Gait speed:

- Slower for healthy + neurological disorder groups
- neurological diseased patients walked slower than age matched controls
- Sig dif betwixt old and young
- Meta regression: age and MMSE (cog measure) sig associated w/ CMi of mental tracking tasks effect on gait speed

Gait Cadence

- Healthy: reduction in cadence for all task conditions
- ND: some tasks shown reduction
- No subgroup relationships
- Not enough for meta regression

Stride Length

- Healthy and ND: reduced in all conditions
- ND reduced more for mental tracking (only comparison possible)

Stride Time: increased for all conditions for both groups

Stride Time Variability: increased all conditions, both groups

# Discussion

Overall Effect

- Gait speed shown to rely on prefrontal cortex activation: supports CMI due to shared neural networks
- Cadence seems less sensitive

Task Type

- Internal factors (mental tracking) seem to be more efficacious for CMI than external (reaction time)
- Reaction time may rely on lower order neural pathways not shared by the higher order control of gait

Age and Cognition

- Data supports age and cognition affecting CMI effect : changes in cognitive and motor systems
- Little data on middle age
- No relationship with age during verbal fluency task

Neurological Disorders

- Similar DT effects as healthy populations
- Gait speed differentiates best

Methods: lack of standardization

- choice of cognitive task
- Standard tasks needed: serial subtraction and word generation tasks  
    (Lezak et al., 2004; Strauss et al., 2006)
    - Little ecological validity (representative of actual life)
- “The use of virtual reality setup involving tasks that are context dependent has recently been shown a potential method to examine the effect of CMI on gait in ecologically valid setting (Kizony et al.,2010).”
- Participant variation
