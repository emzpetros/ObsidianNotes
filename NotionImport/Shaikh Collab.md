Background

Cuff electrodes, evoke different types of tacticle sensations

- Does tonic stim of partcipant, change perception of verticality
- Ankle position is sensed
- Modulate percept of vertically

Whether perception of vertically can be changed via nerve stimulaiton

One person is tilted or not

- change frame of reference
- Illusion of tilt changes, always present in some neurological diseases
- Modulate nerve to change perception of verticality
    - Sitting straight, tilted positions: Apply tactile input in both positions

Unilateral amputees: can only elicit on one side

- macro level of verticality perception is same whether you stand on one or both feet
- Perception moves to bilateral brain areas

  

  

Exp

OLED screen + script

- Judge tilted or not tilted
- MATLAB to generate verticality stimulus
- Run that to get objective measure of verticality
- With stimulation

MOVE system have them tilted

  

Regulatory:

- Add room to IRB + add MOOG

  

First do vertical experiment in our lab just standing + supine

- Portable chin rest to stabilize head

  

  

Send us papers + get code asap

- Just do some testing of set up
- Get it set up in Baltimore , just bring laptop with MATLAB to airport
- Amir Kheradmand

  

2 subjs local and can come on regular basic: one has TBI

- other is elderly, long course of chemo treatment

  

Stimulator

- Desk, cart, + portable on belt
- System on cart is better : full control

  

Aratrik visit

- 8th 9-2 or 10th 8-12
- 2018 paper with technology: another on review with gait coming out soon

  

Logistics

- What question are we asking?

  

- What equipment
- Whatâ€™s needed from us
    - Codes
- Regulatory concerns: IRB approval with new equipment

  

Need OLED

- Monitor or TV, aasef will get

  

MOOG

- Set up in VR!!
- Quest 2: OLED,

  

Action Items

- Aasef: contact Amir, share papers
    - Do we need to wait till we see the demo, can we do something in the meantime 26th , become subject in lab
- Implement in oculus
    - Varjo Aero: measure eye movements
    - Can still start exp on oled screen
- Aratrik: visit lab
- Adding MOOG + Ocular Motility Lab to regulatory

  

# 6-16-2023

Transcutaneous stim as an alternative:

- Either for the intact limb
- Or with able bodied?

3D arrow visualization

Compare with able bodied

Table of params + values

  

Moog: 60

  

upright to 20

What angular velocity? PWS?

Angle of rotation, constant velocity

  

Does plantar sensation affect upright perception?

TENS: specificity, control?
