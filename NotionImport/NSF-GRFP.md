    - Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts must be addressed individually under separate headings in both Personal and Research Plan statements to provide reviewers with the  
        information necessary to evaluate the application with respect to both Criteria.
        - Potential to advance knowledge + benefit society
    
    1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to:
        1. Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
        2. Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
    2. To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
    3. Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan  
        incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
    4. How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
    5. Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed  
        activities?
    
      
    
      
    

# CWRU Webinar 9/27

- Funding people not projects
- Online App: put things into context for reviewer

![[Untitled 657.png]]

Panel:

- Donald Feke: chemical engineering
    - 20-30 faculty : 20-25 each done through online portal
    - 3 people read each application
    - Panel meeting in Jan: discuss highest scoring applications
    - Past, current experiences leading them to know, understand broader impacts (promoting STEM), what makes the tick / who they are: stick in the mind from Dec - Jan
- Charles Rozek: genetics
    - 30-40 to handle volume of applicants
    - Emphasis on individual, broader impact; less on RS but it has to make sense
    - Generate in your own words
    - Convey in a general enough sense for reviewers to understand: diverse audience
- Kathryn Wilcox: macromol., applied as 1st
- Dillon Gagnon: macromol.; applied as 1st
- Roberto!

  

Questions

- 1-5: really only the best get 5’s
- RS: proving you can think about science
- What did you learn from experiences + lead you to other experiences
    - Not just a list of what you’ve done, how did you become who you are today
    - Don’t get lost in weeds of details
- Who you are as an individual

Rec: potential as a scientist, how you solve problems

- Send statements
- Points to hit on
- Cohesive package / story to tell

  

GFRP Feedback:

- Aims lacking in statistical approach to analyze data
- Focus on PS + mentorship interest
- Focus on interdisciplinary work
- Liked mentorship, outreach, broader impact
- IM: too much focus on fundamental science more focus on applications of it
