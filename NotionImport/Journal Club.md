- Human movement influences kinematics in addition to typical gait control
- need to consider this in prosthesis control
- standard symmetry index

![[Untitled 583.png]]

- Results suggest human control over gait timing dominates over mech prosthesis control
- Notion that if human + mech goals don’t align then you may not see benefit: consider providing feedback that forces this alignment

    - Use measures of cognitive effort to assess cognitive load: psychophysiological measures
        - pupil diameter, eye movement, ECG, EMG
    - HR, HR variability, breathing rate, skin conductance, skin temperature
    - “Subjects were asked to compare 100 pairs of 3D objects displayed on a computer screen. They had to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether each of these pairs were the same or mirrored” spatial tasks
    - Evidence that a more difficult motor task in addition to cognitive is needed to see changes
    - Would like to look at brain activation as well
    - HR and breathing freq were most sensitive
    - Also found no gait param differences in symmetrical walking: maybe due to low cog demand of motor task
    
      
    
    - Justification for decreasing cog load even if performance is the same

# 2/2

The effect of a cognitive or motor task on gait parameters of diabetic patients, with and without neuropathy

  

Study

- Walking, motor + walk, serial subtract + walk, seated + count
- DPN gait found to be different, reduce mobility + higher fall risk
- All screened for neuropathy w/ vibration perception threshold, adjustable tuning fork
- Visual acuity more than 6/18 (20/60 vision) was cutoff: participants had close to normal vision
- Worse walking with DPN, tasks made things worse (motor possibly more)

  

More difficulty with motor vs cognitive task

- Unsure if blinding of tray for cups of water task
- May have been sensation loss in hand as well

  

Interlimb reflexes

- Arm and feet in gait

  

4 trials / person : 12 walks each / person

- 60 trials total

  

Motor task

- Also tests how plantar sensation tests a general whole / body movement
    - Walking with a cup of coffee

Results

- statistics between walk conditions without separating populations
- Effect on population condition , can’t look at overall task effect
- Estimated marginal means : compare interaction effect
    
    - Differences of the differences
    - Normal vs walking with task with DPN vs normal vs walking with task with DM
    
      
    

Stability

- Variation

Other motor tasks

- balance something: apple on tray , something that can roll

Step time: fairly consistent

Plantarflexion force is amplified with sensory stimulation during ramping submaximal isometric contractions

  

Abstract

- Cutaneous nerve stim amplifies plantarflexion force output (downward vs dorsi)

  

Background

- Force output modulated by recruiting larger, tireable units
- Perception of force affected by sensory feedback
- Cutaneous afferents as a way to ^ motor output via reducing presynaptic inhibition (sustain contractive force)

  

Methods

- maximal voluntary contractions, practice to stay in range, control 10, 15 with cut. stim

  

Results

  

Discussion

- Facilitation of force output during ramping plantarflexion regardless of top/bottom or UNI/MOD
- **Force perception unaltered, task was more difficult**
- Increased cortical excitability to sensory stim
    - Golaszewski and colleagues (2004)
- Force output facilitation increased with freq

  

Journal Club

- Recap
    - Daekyoo’s increased push off force
- Methods
    - Strapped in and you have to follow the force profile as shown : reaching maximum voluntary contraction during plateau
    - Record from soleus and tibialus anterior
    - Examine force output + cutaneous reflex during plateau
- Stimulation
    - Sensory enhancement during ramping period : uniform or modulated paradigm
    - Stim to produce reflex during force plateau: magnitude of reflex, area under the curve in 150 ms after sim
- Trials
    - Some with just sensory enhancement
    - Some w/ and w/o + cutaneous reflex

  

Why this paradigm of keeping the same force target

  

Sensory enhancement

- Fig 2: aggregation of force traces
    - Unsure how fast targets were instructed to reach target
- Fig 3: once stim was off then force output went back down
    - Would plateau force increase as well if stim was kept on
    - Release profile looks different as a result of stim
- Fig 4: no sig effect in dorsiflexion
- Uniform had most increased but mod was more comfortable

  

Cutaneous reflex

- Fig 6: various increases
- Possible reflex pathways via H reflex that could lead to increased force output
- Could be spinal level or downward sensory control

  

Difficulty of tracing increased but perceived effort was the same

- Uniform was reported harder
- Modulated was more comforable

  

Intended use, weakened muscle response in people that could be increased by sensory enhancement theoretically

  

Applications to us

- Lindsey exp: view “simulated force” via EMG level
- How relevant is direct ankle force output for us
- Why higher pushoff: muscles in residual, upper thigh? entire body effect?
- Does force output happen in seated exp scenario : lower limb vs entire body effect
    - Easier to pinpoint individual EMG changes, harder to detect during walking
- Adapt it to knee flexion extension?
    - Daekyoo showed not any sig kinematic changes i.e. knee angle
    - How is knee related to stronger pushoff
        - Might tell you about stance time modulation, need hip as well
- If we also enhance ramp up force output of plantar flexion, maybe suggests increased push off is also associated with increased muscle activity
    - Connection between residual limb + what’s happening at foot
- See how well you can modulate output force w/ and w/o visual feedback
    - compare modulation ability with intact and pros (SNP on and Off)
    - Fxnal benefits: prevent energy overshoots; achieve better control of robotic control, steadier control

  

Paul Zehr: locomotion + reflex work

- Ask if they’ve looked at other joints

A review of user needs to drive the development of lower limb prostheses

  

Finding of cognitive capacity related to body image

Perceived cognitive burden drop not demonstrated in objective dual task measures

- Possible issue is walking + cog task not demanding enough “

“Advantages of the C-leg may become more apparent under more challenging walking circumstances, such as walking around environmental barriers (ie, ramps, stairs, traffic, uneven, slippery,  
sloping terrain) or under more challenging cognitive circum-  
stances. More challenging cognitive conditions might include  
more difficult neuropsychologic tests, such as the Paced Auditory  
Serial Addition Test (PASAT)28,32 or serial 7 subtract”

Other assessment methods

- Neural, cortical activity
- Visual sampling: more time looking = higher cognitive load

Evaluating performance in the home

- Lab settings not representative, but what about VR!

  

Discussion

- Fxnal needs
    - Listed uneven surface walking
    - Need to look at metabolic cost : gas analyzer
- Ergonomic
    - “less pain”
    - Pain from all sources

  

Connect work to needs of amputees

Could use comprehensive survey study of needs: lit review approach is research biased

  

LLA walk better than expected

  

Focus on related psychological effects as well as fxnal

  

LE06 - could consider microprocessor controlled knee

  

**Look at Table 1 refs:**

- Why you would expect a change even though the brain is “unaffected”
- How do they justify looking at cognitive task performance

Consider noting subjective impressions of performance / attention as well as obj. since they don’t always line up

Factors leading to falls in transfemoral prosthesis users: a case series of sound-side stumble recovery responses

  

Presentation

- Intro
    - Falls for transfemoral
    - Strategies: elevating, lowering, delayed lowering
        - Elevating: lift perturbed foot over obstacle + place it down
        - Lowering: perturbed foot placed back down to floor + cross over obstacle on next step
        - Delayed lowering: some initial elevation first
        - Hopping + skipping used by transfemoral
- Methods
    - 6 unilateral, passive prostheses
    - 0.8 m/s
    - Electromagnetic released metal block : estimate time for block to reach treadmill to control delivery
- Early Swing Trips
    - Elevating strategy, more prosthesis side thigh abduction (swing leg out and forward), more trunk flexion + velocity (falling forward faster)
    - Falls from landing with flexed knee instead of extended
    - Recovery: higher thigh + knee flexion in first step (clear obstacle)
        - Landing with extended knee
    - Ipsilateral = tripped, contralateral = prosthesis / support limb
- Late Swing Trips
    - Recovery: less knee flexion, more thigh abduction
- Mid Swing Trips
    - Participant initiating one recovery strategy but changing to another
        - **looking at reflex vs voluntary control**
    - Other papers: favor intact side
        - [https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17747](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17747)
    - More knee flexion at strike → fall
- Discussion
    - “properly initiating recovery mechanism is key”
    - Prostheses types: all passive, no knee control
        - Could be in wrong state during stumble leading to falls
- Takeaways
    - Methodologies
    - Results

  

Questions

- How does transtibial change the fall strategies
    - Healthy controls do utilize ankle flexion
- Methodology
    - Current experiment: trying to slip/trip or cause falls?
        - Stumbles: accelerate treadmill belt
        - What outcome measures?
            - Knee ankle, trunk flexion + trunk flexion velocity
            - Hadn’t considered thigh flexion : may be an obstacle specific metric
    - Other realistic trips
        - Tether to leg around ankle : pull taut to trip
    - Obstacle hitting both limbs
- Letters on figures: multiple trips of same type
- Imagine a perfect prosthesis with equal angles + voluntary control, no sensation
    - Less likely to fall?
    - Possibly still higher risk
    - Studies have shown sensation still contributes to falls
    - [https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17747](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17747)
        - Powered knees in last chapter
        - Experiment apparatus was a chapter
    - Daekyoo: sensation may reduce fall risk
    - Transtibial falling lacking: technological limitation
        - May not get to full volitional control vs state based detection
        - Add a fall recovery state?
- **New treadmill June**
    - Delivery method of acceleration / deacceleration : intent for PT to reduce fall risk, practice stumbling, not intended for full fall
    - Decent placeholder for a full on fall, metrics can correlate with fall risk + recovery mechs

  

![[Untitled 586.png]]

- Daekyoo - Falls
    - COM position + GRF vector : vector goes behind COM
    - Report COM + GRF relationship first, then go into knee + trunk kinematics - submeasures of primary interaction
        - WB angular momentum measure
- Trunk metrics are stand ins for COM
- AP Foot Pos relative to COM: center of pressure relative to center of mass
    - COP COM distance
- Fall recovery mechanism
    - Base of support: in 3D, explain BoS + COM
        - COP = application point of GRF
        - GRF passes through COM = stable
    - Look in more detail to see which part was the problem

Electromyography-based control of lower limb prostheses: a systematic review

  

Topics

- Task type: weight bearing + non weight bearing
    - Non weight bearing: just prosthetic
- Additional sensors: IMU, depth sensors, goniometer (angle), laser distance, load cells, foot switch
- Direct Control
    - Proportional angle control
    - Model-based control: body segments as rigid bodies
- Machine Learning
    - Phase or non phase needed
    - Pre process → feature extraction → classify
    - Performance based on : errors of classification, critical errors
- Challenges:
    - Degradation of EMG: physical (electrode shift) or physiological (fatigue)
    - Transitions
    - Stumble/Slip detection

  

Discussion

- Task based classification (machine learning) : change state
- Direct Control: continuously read EMG + move ankle
- Model based control: Pittsburg Rehab Neural Lab
    - DARPA haptix performer, upper extremity
    - Lee Fischer doing similar project
    - Feed EMG signal into biomechanical model, determine intended action

  

Previous Work - Evan

- What is the added value of EMG?? Control can be accomplished with non-bio sensors alone
    - Transition between ambulation modes
- State based control (indirect) vs Direct Control
    - Or hybrid approach! Determine mode + then use EMG to adjust parameters
    - Need to do something new
    - Need some ground truth to use with the EMG signal
- Gait detection : Justin + Anish
    - IMU, insole sensors
    - Allow free walking + should be able to integrate with rest of system
- What should be controlled? angle? torque? velocity?
    - Upper extremity has more developed work
    - Changes what your features correspond to
        - Keep contracting to maintain an angel
        - Contract to move + then another set generates new movement
- Filtering: developing a board in ASCU / UECU to process EMG, could stream data to Speedgoat
    - Currently using wireless Delsys sensors
    - For long distance, outside lab need to move away from Delsys
    - Know limitations of board : Carol Biomedical developing the board
        - FPGA: can do FFT, feature extraction
        - Microcontroller
- Baysian Inference Class: expands knowledge of how to interpret statistically
- Direct control could also be a machine learning process
- Delay in control system
    - EMG activation after trip: 70ms
- User control + sensing foot/floor interactions: can that improve responses to stumbles / trips
- Latency timing becoming more important
    - Delay from signal input to subject perception
    - LE03: anectodedly noted delay
    - Never been characterized in detail
    - Subject perception end is difficult; exclude perception + just get system latency
- Bree: Visuotactile synchrony of stimulation-induced sensation and natural somatosensation
    - Shines light + delivers stim, which one came first
    - Used actuator to poke skin + deliver stim: which came first
    - How stim compares to other sensory stimuli
    - Inherent latency in system still not characterized
- Experiment: no subject, output of system to scope
    - Can record timing of weights on insole
    - Delay between gait event + stim output of perc board
    - Wireless woodstock communication slows it down

Dual Tasking during Trip Recovery and Obstacle Clearance among Young, Healthy Adults in Human Factors Research

  

Trips:

- CoM going outside base of support, should still be able to recover
    - Indicator stability more than falls
    - Bring swing limb forward to stop momentum
- Responses: reflex + higher cortical structures
    - 70ms latency in muscle responses
- Few details of trip effects

Secondary Cognitive Tasks

- Visual
    - Adding a congruent test version?
    - Visuospatial task: walkway based task may be better
    - Effects: more time + space given to obstacle clearing
        - Overcompensation, not an accurate assessment of the obstacle height
        - Courtney’s obstacle clearance task
- Auditory Tests
    - Aspects of memory task to remember what the high / low sounds like
- Speech + Verbal Tasks
    - Seems hard to standardize
    - Task needs to be harder for performance to be reduced on motor + cog. tasks
- Memory Based
    - Digit monitoring: count how many times you hear a number during a trial
    - N-back: n number of signals, how many

Secondary Motor Tasks

- Anterior load carrying: changes CoM, can also occlude vision
- Carrying Objs: realistic task

  

Structural Int: tasks with similar inputs + outputs

Capacity Int: overload general Central processing ability

  

Takeaways:

- Single task may actually have many components: response modality, memory aspect
- Cater instructions to the research question

[The role of executive function and attention in gait - Yogev‐Seligmann - 2008 - Movement Disorders - Wiley Online Library](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.21720)

Executive Function

- Prefrontal cortex: dorsolateral specifically
- Aging = cognitive reduction: explicit memory (intentional, conscious recollection)
- Gait: decreased walking speed, stride to stride variability, step width variability

Attention: selective, divided, etc

- Prioritization tasks activate…: inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex,=

DTCost:

- Reduced performance in one or both tasks
- Larger costs in neurological patients than young adults + age-matched
    - **Healthy: reduce gait speed or cog task performance, kept gait stability**
    - **Neurological group had gait instability**
    - Possible Cause: posture first strat w/ healthy pop
- DT walking performance is a sensitive predictor of fall risk

Steady state walking on treadmill is mostly automatic vs overground costs more attention

Theories: capacity, shared resources, multi resource

  

Our Subjs

- Choice of second cognitive task: load system but not stress participant
    
- Differences in DT performance between subjects + general task availability
- Choice of motor task?
- LLA specifically:
    - DK believes there is no loss of cognitive ability that would cause DT interference

  

## Discussion

Healthy = reduced speed, neurological = gait instability: what metrics should we be looking at?

- Stride to stride step width , variability
- Angular momentum

We don’t know exact neurological mechanism, do LLA have any prefrontal cortex issues

- Use EEG to quantify that

How amputee DT performance compared to able-bodied?

- Input to cognitive circuitry disrupted, more coordination to move prosthesis
- How does plantar sensation play a role

Looking for improvements in gait stability

  

Introduce perturbation

- In real life environment is where issue comes up, unexpected inputs
- Unsteady mats

  

Dynamic difficulty

- 3 difficultly levels of intervals
- Deliver next word immediately after response (sound threshold)

  

Difference in gait parameters

Prioritization may be different from able bodied

  

Look into grant for EEG or FNir s? to look at neurological activity

  

3 seconds is enough for a single gait cycle

  

Could use separate laptop projection

  

Make it so they sometimes have to say the word vs the color

# Sensing leg movement enhances wearable monitoring of energy expenditure - James Baker

[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24173-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24173-x)

## Presentation Notes

Background: monitoring can help with global lack of activity, current tests are only good for lab work or are inaccurate (smartwatch)

4 Experiments

- Wearable-data driven
- Extend model to time-varying activites
- Designing + training device
- Testing with new subject data

Experiment 1

- 5 mins / condition

![[Untitled 587.png]]

- Data-Driven Model: EMG, IMU, force sensing insole
    - One leg EMG

Experiment 2: time varying

- Discrete or sinusoidal treadmill speed changes
- Interpolated ground truth of respirometry data

Experiment 3

- Implement wearable device
- Compare to general Apple Watch + activity specific: just heart rate + gyro
- Running, walking, biking, stair stepping

Experiment 4: new subjects

  

Code: python, tutorial on GitHub

  

First 44 seconds: accuracy of wearable system even better than respirometry

  

![[Untitled 588.png]]

- Smart watch does significantly worse with stairs and bike when not activity specific

  

Experiment 4 results

![[Untitled 589.png]]

  

Interpreting

![[Untitled 590.png]]

Shank gyro in Y-axis differentiator

Figure A = model coefficients

Gyro data is much more important

Did they look at interaction effects between inputs?

- Did they evaluate how good the model is
- Adding variables isn’t always good

Figure B

- Stages of gait cycle
- Curve actual measurement of sensor

  

Relevance for us

- metabolic cost of ambulation for amputees
- Amputees have different lower limb kinematics
- Two models: one on limb, one on prosthesis

Ground truth:

- Daekyoo’s model to estimate mechanical work
- Respirometry

We can tolerate an offset since each subj is own control, just comparing SNP on or off

But if variance in data is too high, no nuance

IMUs with UECU and Woodstock?

- Is that enough
- How sensitive is outcome to IMU placement

Daekyoo:

- COM tells you just about that, need also joint information
- SNP may affect push off work but the rest may not be influenced
- Double limb support time
- Prosthetic push off work, intact collision work: occurs at same time

  

Assess how well model works with amputee population

## Relevant Notes

IMUs

- Trained data with random rotations to sensors to improve robustness

- Data Processing
    - OpenSense - relies on OpenSim musculoskeletal simulator
    - “data to inverse kinematic solver to estimate lower-limb kinematics while meeting musculoskeletal constraints”
    - “Initial calibration + solver rest for each condition to limit error from sensor drift
- Coded in python, Matlab, Motion Analysis, Open Sim

System evaluation

- System Usability Scale and User Interaction Satisfaction

## Random Notes

Accuracy tested by building model w/o one subject, estimating for that subject and computing the error

Error increased when changing activities: need a data set for each activity to be monitored

Multiple sensors: IMU, muscle activity, kinematics, vertical ground reaction forces

IMU on thigh and shank

Changes in placement prone to errors: fix = random initial rotations in the training data

estimated energy expenditure once per stride

Lower limb kinematics as input, segmented by stride  
HR did not improve accuracy

Smart phone upgrades for future work
