Graven Images

P73:

- Seeing translations of a work in different mediums as a constellation, different faces
- No translation or reproduction has the authority of the original
- Comics occupy the same space as a translation, lacking the original authority but having the same value as any other rerepresentation

Visual Rep of the Divine in Comics

- Images must be metaphorical to get at the larger un understandable reality of god
- 113 god grows more distant and incarnate god increases in importance
- 116 list of images of divine all used in picture bible
- 117 symbols vs signs: pointing to more or just one meaning
- You need a variable and absurd rerepresentation to properly communicate god

218

- Evangelical in nature
- Spread the word in media but also remain separate from it's secular influences
- 221 David c cook!
- “sacred content and secular form” 222; religious message and sensibilities first
- 227 making a value judgement on a worldview
- Emphasizes content over form 228
- 227 “christian comics” not comparable with mainstream comics

63

- Comics made for kids gives more authority, coloring books too

  

  

Text Image and Otherness in Chidlren’s Bibles

- 14 interestingly, making a specific bible for kids excludes kids from the actual bible
- 15 children’s bibles as more altered than mere translations, protecting kids from contradictory or difficult topics
- 16 can become a self fulfilling prophecy
    - For bibles specifically even adult conceptions can be mostly drawn from kids bibles
- Overall idealization of bible stories and the children audience
- Goal of children’s bible is less about “fidelity” to the text
- Portrayal of kids in the bible
    - changes to protect images of enslaved kids
    - loses message of the small being important and powerful
- What has been removed / added, what is the role of children
- Explain interpretative choices

  

Pt II

- Education of Children via bibles
- 34 example of Protestant Reformation putting the Bible in hands of ordinary people
- Adults choose the stories, translate them, and often deliver them
- Concept of creationist bibles undermining traditional religious authority
    - Casts doubt on traditional authorities: education, teachers etc
    - “Others” secular society + emphasizes traditional values
- These concepts apply worldwide due to globalization
- CB considered a “translation” and thus have claim to divine authority
- “medium + manner of info transfer is as important as the message itself" **content and form**
    - _Graven Images_ source claims the content in evangelical bibles overshadows the form to the whole package’s detriment
- Creationism evolved into an alternate to mainstream science vs a different theological interpretation
- 38: interestingly the creationist account of the bible is greatly amended
- Interactivity of bibles (pop-ups, modern characters) makes it easier for child to be part of the story
- These bibles teach one truth and discredit another
- 42: ironically creationist bibles expect blind obedience to this new belief after being told to question other sources of authority
- 46 Creationist bibles
    - share authority of other bibles
    - uniquely shorten the canon and support a singular interpretation
    - Loses flexibility across generations
    - worrying lack of diversity + choice for kids

Daniel

- 53 Daniel is not easily relatable to a contemporary child
- Layers of communication: to the adult purchaser, divine authority, editor
- 56 Daniel in the den is emotionally engaging for children, why?
- 57 have to describe the other visually to understand it as a threat and contrast it
- 59 struggle of interpreting images
- 60 children need to learn visual language and how to recognize the same entity in different angles
- 62 verisimilitude vs truth
- 63 how to convey info without stereotypes ah
- 66 lion as loved and dressed , ambivalence, god as lion vs Shepard
- 68 children's fear being eaten by animals, turned on by parents (someone with power to protect has power to harm”
    - Being in a place of danger + being “good enough to eat” but being safe
    - “Reassurance that those who could eat you do not to”

David and Jonathon

- Social hierarchy aspects, Jonathon as model of friendship
- David as an analogue to Jesus
- 137 older teachings of it focus on how friendly behavior may only be about appearances; asking complex questions about it
    - **danger p16 self fulfilling prophecy of dumbed down concepts**
- 141 Jonathon stands apart as better than both David + Saul in some ways

Translating Bible into pictures 271

- Genesis and Cain and Able
- Comics = language so the Bible is a translation, also these Bibles tend to emphasize accuracy to content
- Translation as domesticating or foreignizing
- Cain and Abel
    - Rejection of cain’s sacrifice, mark of cain, killing of abel
    - Comic Book Bible
        - Cain visually as bad guy, justification for gods favor offered
        - violence ommitted
    - Picture Stories from the Bible
        - See into their hearts
        - Sons as adults, nearly sthe same
    - Manga Bible
        - villain portrayal
    - Multiple have order of sacrifice reversed
    - Moral message: failure of attitude, jealousy, greed
- sophisticated use of the medium in question
    - Some work with simple art to aid identification in the reader
- Brick Testament
    - literal reading and otherness of the bible
    - Focus on violence
    - bad comics translation but for a purpose
- Bible very much an adult book

Historical Perspective

- Content, details, childrens response, moedium, how are they illustrated
- motivtions for children to read biblel stories influence how they are told

what does a child want

- Authors have own agenda, special status of the text
- publishers: biases
- Buyers: adults
- Readers: kids, sometimes read ot
- Treat bible as greek mythology tellings?
- Convey 342 the diversity + complexity of the bible
- Grimms tales telling the world how it is, originally not meant for children but they started reading them anyway

  

Gospel According to Superheros

p211 “primacy of stories” they describe our reality

  

Contro of biblical meaning

- Canon exists, does it derive meaning from some inherent quality in the texts or the collection
- From iteslf or from institutional authority, history, outside factors

3 types of translation

babble/Babel line 62

- translation makes text accesssible, but we cannot know its accuracy

63 special danger and risk of intermedial translation

authority in interlingual

- Christian acceptance of translation
- logocentric: text holds the meaning but physically isnt’ necessary?
- dynamic equivalence: physical container doesn’t change meaning 68
    - Good translation is always possible
    - just convey content of message

Vs literal translation

- Only authoritatitve and accurate insomuch as the same process of translation was used
- explores linguistic depth of the material
- its oddities and strangeness comes out

Represents a spectrum, another spectrum of good and bad within

Connotation

- Ideological + intertextual
- Problems for translation
    - All words that denote also connote
    - narrative
    - Can support or interfere with denotation

80: allusion to passover and the many languages of the disciples

Christian view accounts for the the violence and contradiction betwixt old and new testament + the 4 gospels

- As long as meaning is preserved it is all fine

Drive to a singular interpretation
