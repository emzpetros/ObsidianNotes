# 12/14 Post-Modeling Review

  

Classes

  

TA Advice

- Not Gratzyl, disorganized
- Be proactive about TAing, talk to Dr. MG early
- Can be beneficial to do it early

  

  

Quals

- Content
    - Your project + 3 core classes: modeling, 401 (circuits optics filtering), cell bio, modeling
    - Study cell bio content!!
- Mock quals
    - 3 older students April / May, they’ll ask questions they’ve been asked
- Advice
    - Having to learn project last minute can be hard, find one you can study for and talk about
    - Don’t say anything you can’t elaborate on
    - Hard to prep, everyone is different
    - How does class work apply to my project??
        - Twist it in any way
- Structure
    - Likely on Zoom
    - 30 mins total
        - Each grades 1-5 on each section
        - All profs meet and rank everyone, decide cutoff for P/F
        - Typical fail rate is 20%, last year 30%
    - Draw on an ipad: talk + draw (charge pen!)
        - Models, graphs, electrode circuit diagram
        - Instrumentation: cameras work, antibodies, excitation emission
            - Camera taken, processing
    - 5 mins: explain what project is, what, how, why
        - Real one: you get interrupted along the way
        - Craft speech to present things you are confident in + are able to talk about
        - Guide the exam
    - 6 profs announced 2 weeks before: you get 3
        - Profs will ask what they know
    - 2 weeks to deliberate
        - Don’t hear how exactly you did if you pass
- Compartment modeling: most people asked to draw them
    - Examples: hobby, digestion, one that relates to the project , release of cytokines at electrode injury site
    - Saidel’s notes have examples :
        - Drug kinetics , // compartment flow : can be flexible to most scenarios
    - equations too
        - Know how would you solve it
- Lab practice quals
    - Neural mats from Lindsey
- Study
    
    - Not about memorization
    - Figure out what you don’t know: see how you reason through something you don’t know the answer to
    - Don’t try and act like you know something, say you think if you’re not sure
    - Know everything from sample to data
    - Lindsey: started Fall semester, fell off, restarted Feb
        - Final project geared toward your project work
    - Work on weak points
    
      
    
      
    

Actual quals

- They’ll ask anything about anything
- Profs don’t know what’s in the classes
    - Might not know about modeling switch
    - Go through Saidel’s notes : kidney compt. modeling
- Equation solving: true for 90% of profs
    - But Dr. M may be on board: dimensionless, sep of vars, characteristic eq, comp model + write eqs + how to solve
    - Can’t do anything more than 10 mins
- Mofet, Gracyck, Yu:
    - Compartment models from class
    - Mofet asked for detailed circuitry
- Karathanasis was on board last time
- Unsure of how modifications to classes will affect things
    - Likely becoming easier, profs + students not happy with 30% rate
- Won’t have profs you directly work with : maybe no one on committee
- Lots of scare tactics: make you learn your project inside + out, know how to talk about project
- Likely pass everyone 2nd time , PIs can vouch for you
- Be prepared for variability
