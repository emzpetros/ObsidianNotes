Literature Type: Paper
Objective of study: Comparing adults and children, mixed and unmixed
Methods: |-
  Compared unmixed + mixed trial blocks

  Instructions: “Participants were informed that they would see words written in various colours (red, blue, green, or yellow). They had to name out loud the colour the word was written in, ignoring whatever the word spelt out. Following long‐standing standard response instructions (MacLeod & MacDonald, 2000; Rand et al., 1963), participants were informed of the importance of keeping errors low, but also of responding to the hues as quickly as they were able”

  Use of a fixation cross to keep participant focus

  500ms delay to next trial after response detected
Outcome Measures: "Reaction time: median used to avoid outlier effects"
Key Results: |-
  Children had more errors in unmixed
  Adults had more errors in mixed

  Children respond slower on all tasks

  Mixed vs Unmixed
  - No difference in response errors
  - for response speed, congruent only block was faster
  - children errors and RT increased going from congruent to incongruent in unmixed condition
Conclusions: Mixed tasks are better to avoid an incorrect strategy accidently working
Core paper?: No
Key terms: children,stroop,vstroop
Name:
  - "[[What Stroop tasks can tell us about selective attention from childhood to adulthood]]"
Status: Ready to start
