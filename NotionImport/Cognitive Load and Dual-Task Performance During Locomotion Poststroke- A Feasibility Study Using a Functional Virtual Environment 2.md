Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task,VR
Objective of study: "Dual tasking in ecological (functional) environments, feasibility "
Summary: |-
  VE for dual tasking have potential
  Specific study found little DT interference effects
  Did see a speed up effect not consistent with other studies
Materials: |-
  Self paced treadmill
  VR CAREN
  Bar to simulate pushing shopping cart

  Shop for item by touching it in response to audio cue
Methods: |-
  12 stroke and 10 healthy
  No measure of cognitive ability ?

  Conditions: one item, one item that was changed, 2 items, 5 items

  Baseline walking and standing w/ shopping for items

  2-5 blocks of 4 trials

  Analysis of third walking baseline + 2nd experimental block: account for fatigue + learning, + adaptation to task
Theory: |-
  Investigation of which cognitive tasks had most effect
  Which environments: initial findings point toward environment having effect, VR can help investigate this further 
Outcome Measures: |-
  MATLAB algo detection of gait cycle events
  Stride length, duration, cadence, gait speed from motor output
  Coef of variation - % of sd over mean for variation metric 

  Task completion: number + type of mistakes (forget item, wrong one, extra)

  Comparison of overground + treadmill walking
Key Results: |-
  Gait Speed: tendency to walk faster with task, S group had greater variability 
  Stride Length: controls had longer stride lengths, tendency to decrease w/ task
  Cadence: tendency to increase with task

  Very few significant effects found

  Task Completion: overall both groups only made minor mistakes
Conclusions: |
  Slower in VE environment: maybe due to having to hold handle or extra visual processing
  Did not compare overground walking while holding a similar handle

  No significant differences in gait;
  - High subj variability 
  - Did find condition 1 had an increase in gait speed

  Different task than typical 
  Unfamiliar with self paced treadmill 

  Could have prioritized walking over shopping task
  Motor learning: learning new walking task
  Focus on shopping: walking more “automatic” closer to overground speeds
Future work suggested: |-
  Investigate prioritization and motor learning influences 
  Is speeding up an effective strat for those w/ stroke
Critiques: |-
  Small sample size
  Relatively simple task and not a standard one
  Cofounding factors with the new task
