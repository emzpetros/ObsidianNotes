Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: “To summarize evidence related to dual-task standing and walking in people with lower limb amputation and discuss implications for future research.”
Summary: "Research does not conclusively support increase dual task interference with amputees despite self reported data supporting this theory.  Issues may be with the parameters used and study methods.  High variance in tasks and subject characteristics "
Materials: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science
Methods: Literature search
Theory: |-
  Reduced postural stability, more energy used walking, slower sped, gait asymmetries
  ”concentrate on every step”

  Assumption of limited cognitive resources 

  DT studies affected by
  - Choice of motor + cognitive tasks
  - directions for task prioritization
  - inclusion of baseline single task 

  DT studies do not uniformly support data from surveys that indicates amputees have to devote more focus to walking
Key Results: |-
  DT Standing
  - Study / Sample Characteristics: exclusion assessment based on memory + attention not described 
  - Methods: 
  postural sway (CoP displacement + velocity), weight-bearing symmetry
  Cognitive task = mental tracking (math fxns) or discrimination / decision making (choice reaciton time with visual / audio stim)
  Most used Vstroop, substitute serial sub for color issues 
  - Results: 
  postural sway = 2 greater sway in amputees at start of rehab, improvement; only 1 found sig dif betwixt dual and single task sway
  2 did complex standing = neither had statistically dif single vs dual task
  Regardless of task: postural control worse for amputees

  DT Walking
  - Study / Sample:  one study used Montreal Cog. Assessment
  small samples
  3/4 included age + sex matched controls
  - Methods: 
  One did just reaction time, no statistical analysis 
  Walking performance: speed , gait variability at self selected speed

  Cognitive tasks: serial subtraciton, Vstroop and astroop
  3/4 did not specify task prioritization 
  - Results: often high variability, overall tasks did not affect walking in amputees more than controls 
  Walking was worse in amputees but not affected by dual task condition 
  Any declines in amputee group also found in controls

  Some self report data of needing to “pay attention” when walking on unstable surfaces

  Microprocessor controlled prostheses 
  - Study / Sample: participants were own controls
  - Methods: 
  most didn’t report single task performance
  measure of effort (heart rate) as well as reaction time, sway, walking speed
  Cognitive Task: reading numbers on screen vstroop, verbal fluency, serial subtraction + backward digit span
  - Results: only one found increased walking speed with prosthesis 
  Challenging terrain: improvement in all knee conditions; may be due to arousal effect or order (single task done first)
  Self reported reductions in cog load w/ microprocessor prosthesis
Conclusions: |-
  Some findings of effect in standing but not in walking may be due to participant characteristics (age + vascular issues)
  Some improvement found with microprocessor prosthesis for those classified as limited ambulators already 

  May be need for more challenging walking conditions, reflective of home / community environments
Future work suggested: |-
  Large sample size 
  Characteristics not generalizable: age, etiology, functional ability
  - Are some subgroups affected more

  Need to record single task performance of postural + cognitive

  Need to provide instructions regarding task prioritization to determine where the interference is expected to manifest

  Challenging or unpredictable surfaces

  Outcome measures may not be sensitive enough!
  - Change focus to postural and assess cognitive outcomes? “residual standard deviation,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309364618785728?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed# functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309364618785728?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed# or psychophysiological measureshttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309364618785728?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#” or error rate to get at processing speed

  More standardized self report
Critiques: |-
  Should measure single task performance
  Control group comparison

  More challenging walking task?  Respond to VR obstacles while doing cognitive task
  Maybe lift foot?
