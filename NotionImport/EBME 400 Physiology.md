# Chapter 1 Functional Organization of the Human Body and Control of the “Internal Environment”

Extracellular Fluid: Na, Cl, bicarbonate ions, CO2 nutrients - O, glucose, fatty acids, amino acids

Intracellular: K, Mg, phosphate

  

All systems contribute to maintaining homeostasis

- Circulatory system: moves blood throughout body, diffusion of fluid via capillaries to intercellular spaces between cells
- Respiratory: oxygen + CO2
- Gastrointestinal: absorb carbs, fatty acids, amino acids from food
- Liver + Kidneys: convert raw substances, waste removal
- Musculoskeletal: mobility to get food + stay away from danger
- Nervous System: sensory input, CNS, motor output portion; autonomic system - internal organ function; regulate muscular + secretory activities
- Hormone: regulate cellular metabolic fxn
- Immune: self vs foreign, destroy invaders
- Integumentary (skin + such): protect, regulate temp
- Reproduction: more people

  
Control Systems: operate within organs + interrelations betwixt organs

- Examples
    - Oxygen-buffering fxn of hemoglobin: hemoglobin combined w/ O will not release it into areas of high O []
    - High CO2 [] = excited respiratory center
    - Arterial blood pressure: baroreceptors stimulated by stretching of arteries - low pressure = relaxed receptors and activation of vasomotor to raise it

![[Untitled 34.png]]

- Characteristics
    - Negative feedback
    - Gain = correction / error (unprevented change): how effective a control system is
        - Ex -2, -33; higher is more effective
    - Positive feedback: sometimes useful but as part of a larger negative feedback process, clotting, action potentials
- Adaptive control: delay negative feedback
    - Fast muscle movements: assess the performance + correct it next time it’s performed

  

# Chapter 2 The Cell and Its Functions

Cells made of protoplasm: water, ions (K, Mg, phosphate, sulfate, bicarbonate, Na, Cl, Ca), proteins lipids, carbs (nutrition)

- Structural proteins: filaments, microtubules
- Functional proteins: enzymes often embedded in membranes
- Lipids: soluble in fat solvents not water - membrane barriers; fat storage

Physical structure: organelles

![[Untitled 35.png]]

  

Cell Membrane: 7.5-10nm

- Lipid bilayer: cholesterol regulates fluidity
- Proteins: channels, carriers, receptors, enzymes
- Glycocalyx: carb coating - “-” charge, receptors, attachement

Cytoplasm: cytosol

Organelles

- Endoplasmic Reticulum: tubules + vesicles; enzymes on surface for metabolism, transport
- Ribosomes: synthesize new proteins
- Golgi Apparatus: works w/ ER
- Lysosomes: break off from GA for “digestion”
    - 250-750 nm, full of hydrolase (digestive) enzymes
- Peroxisomes: self-replication or budding from ER; oxidases to form hydrogen peroxide
- Secretory Vesicles: from ER-GA
- Mitochondria:
    - Outer + inner bilayers, self-replicative
    - Matrix contains enzymes for oxidation of nutrients —> ATP
- Cytoskeleton: filaments + tubules, microtubules
- Nucleus: DNA —> genes —> determine what proteins are made + controls cell reproduction
    - Nuclear envelope: two bilayers, one in the other
    - Nucleolus: large amounts of RNA + proteins

  

Cells vs Precellular Life

Development of membrane enclosing matrix, organelles, nucleus - control center

  

Cell Functions

- Ingestion of substances
    - Diffusion, active transport
    - Endocytosis:
        - Pinocytosis: tiny particles in vesicles (100-200nm)
            - Receptors attach to molecules in coated pits: contraction of membrane pinches off bit of extracellular fluid
            - Contractile of protein fibers: clathrin, maybe actin + myosin
        - Phagocytosis: only larger cells
    - Digestion via lysosomes: fuse w/ vesicles
        - Also reduce tissue size + remove dead / damaged cells
- Formation of Cellular Structures
    - Granular ER = proteins, smooth = lipids, ER also makes lots of enzymes
    - GA: synthesize carbs
    - Movement of substances via vesicles from ER to GA:
        - then in exocytosis out of cell via secretory vesicles (stimulated by entry of Ca)
        - Intracellular vesicles to renew membranes
    - Mitochondria:
        
        - ATP: nitrogenous base adenine, pentose sugar ribose, 3 phosphate radicals via high-energy phosphate bonds
        - Glucose —> pyruvic acid —> acetyl-CoA —> citric acid cycle —> H atoms combine w/ O to give energy to convert ADP to ATP
            - Removal of e- from H —> ion; ion combines w/ O to form H2O + release energy to ATP synthetase
        
        ![[Untitled 36.png]]
        
        - ATP used for… membrane transport, synthesis, mechanical work
- Locomotion
    
    - Ameboid (entire cell): pseudopodium that pulls cell with it
        - Requires receptors to attach to tissue + energy to pull the cell
        - Actin in cytoplasm polymerizes to form filamentous network which contracts with myosin fueled by ATP
        - White blood cells
        - Controlled via chemotaxis: chemical [] for signlaing
    
    ![[Untitled 37.png]]
    
    - Cilia: whip-like motion in respiratory airways + fallopian tubes
        
        - Fast forward movement, slow backwards
        - Mechanism: tubule network - axoneme, ATP + good ionic conditions (Mg + Ca)
        - “the release of energy from ATP in contact with the  
            ATPase dynein arms causes the heads of these arms to  
            “crawl” rapidly along the surface of the adjacent double  
            tubule. If the front tubules crawl outward while the back  
            tubules remain stationary, this will cause bending”
        
          
        

# Ch 3 Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis, Cell Fxn, and Cell Reproduction

![[Untitled 38.png]]

DNA: phosphoric acid, deoxyribose, AT GC

- Strands held together by H bonds
- Genetic code conveyed in triplet codons

Transcription: transfer to RNA (AUracil GC)

- RNA activated by RNA polymerase: adds 2 phosphate radicals to combine w/ ATP + release energy to connect more RNA nucleotide
    - Weak hydrogen bond betwixt DNA + RNA chains
    - Polymerase binds to promoter sequence
    - Ends at chain-terminating seq
- RNA types
    - Messenger = carries code to cytoplasm
    - Transfer = brings amino acids to ribosomes
        - specificity for codons via anticodon triplets
    - Ribosomal = forms ribosomes
        - forms 60% of ribosomes, rest is proteins (structural + enzymes)
        - subunits formed in nucleolus + assembled in cytoplasm
    - MicroRNA = single strands 21-23 RNA mol to regulate transcription + translation
        
        - Transcribed not translated
        
        ![[Untitled 39.png]]
        
- Codons to amino acids: most represented by more than one, one for start, 3 for stop
- Translation
    - One strand can pass through multiple ribosomes - polyribosomes
    - Most resulting proteins released into cytosol, some into ER
    - Protein Synthesis:
        - Amino acids activated via ATP - 2 phosphate bonds
        - Activated AA combines w/ tRNA which matches its anticodon to codon of mRNA
        - Via peptidyl transferase peptide bonds (OH- and H+ form water) are formed - cost 2 more phosphate bonds

  

Control of Gene Fxn

- Genetic Regulation: activation of genes + formation of products controlled
    - Allows for responding to environment, specialize fxn
    - Affects anything in transcription, RNA processing, translation
        - Transcription controlled via promotor - TATA box binding site
            - Upstream binding sites have + or - effects on transcription
        - Enhancers: areas of DNA that can bind transcription factors
            - Can be far way in the chain, close when coiled
    - Chromosomal insulators prevent undue transcriptional influence
    - Control via regulatory proteins further along DNA
    - Control via which chromosomes become unpacked
- Enzyme Regulation: activity levels of already present enzymes controlled
    - Inhibition: substances bind to first enzyme in process + cause conformational change
    - Activation: i.e. cAMP activating glycogen-splitting enzymes after building up due to ATP breakdown

  

Cell Reproduction

- DNA replication: 4-8 hrs
    - DNA polymerase + DNA ligase (bonding)
    - Uncoiling via enzymes
- DNA proofreading
- Chromosomes: 46
    - Replication of chromosomes (adding protein bits) occurs —> chromatids held together via centromere
- Mitosis: 1-2 hrs after ^
    
    - Centrioles begin to move apart: radial growths form aster
        - Microtubules forming = spindle, whole complex = mitotic apparatus
    
    ![[Untitled 40.png]]
    
- Prophase: spindle + condensed chromosomes form
- Prometaphase: tubules attach to chromatid of chromosomes
- Metaphase: chromosomes pulled to center
- Anaphase: chromosomes pulled apart
- Telophase: new nuclear membrane forms, cell pinches in two
- Control of Reproduction
    - Growth factors in blood or tissues, physical space limits, inhibition observed in presence of cell’s own secretions
    - Cell size: amount of functioning DNA in nucleus, more RNA, more proteins

  

Cell Differentiation

- Achieved via selective repression of gene promotors
- Inductions: differentiation affected by adjacent cells

  

Apoptosis: programmed cell death

- Disassembly + phagocytosis vs necrosis via bursting
- Started via caspase enzymes

  

Cancer

- Caused from mutations or abnormal activation of genes related to growth + mitosis (oncogenes)
- Antioncogenes typically prevent their activation
- Most mutations are harmless: cell dies, maintains growth regulation, or is killed by immune system (abnormal proteins) , multiple oncogenes needed for cancer
- Increased chance of mutations
    - Ionizing radiation, carcinogens, physical irritants, hereditary tendency, viruses
- Cancer cells… don’t have limited growth, less adhesive to one another (spreads), angiogenic factors
- Death via competition for nutrients

  

# Ch 4 Transport of Substances Through Cell Membranes

![[Untitled 41.png]]

Diffusion: movement via random movement

Active Transport: movement against an energy gradient

  

Diffusion

- Simple: no carrier proteins involved, rate increases w/ []
    - Through lipid bilayer… O, N, CO2, alchohols
    - Through protein channels… water, slows with larger mols
        - Selectively permeable via diameter + electrical charges: dehydrates ions or mols to allow passage
        - Gating: all or nothing, rapid open + close
            - Voltage: electrical potential across cell membrane
            - Chemical (ligand)
- Facilitated: maximum diffusion rate limited by time to change state
- Net rate:
    
    - Concentration: net rate into cell = Con out - Con in
    - Nernst pot:
    
    ![[Untitled 42.png]]
    
    - Pressure difference: more mols striking one side
- Osmosis
    - Osmotic pressure: amount to stop osmosis, determined by # of particles / unit vol or ultimately the molar []
    - Osmolality: osmole = 1 gram molecular weight of osmotically active solute (how many particles something dissociates into )

  

Active Transport: Na, K, Ca, ions etc

- Primary: energy via ATP
    
    - Na-K pump: Na out + K in
        
        ![[Untitled 43.png]]
        
        - AP + cell vol - more ions pumped out, osmosis out of cell to prvent bursting
    - Ca ions: pumps Ca out of cell, pumps to move Ca into vesicles
    - H ions: gastric glands in stomach to secrete HCl acid, ducts of kidneys to get rid of excess H
    - Energy: proportional to log of degree of substance []
    
    ![[Untitled 44.png]]
    
- Secondary: energy from ionic [] differences
    - Co-transport: diffusion along create gradient couples w/ + pulls another substance through
        - Sodium co transport of glucose + amino acids
    - Counter-transport: one in and one in
        - Na Ca, Na H transport
- Both use carrier proteins that this time provide energy
- Active Transport via cellular sheets
    
    - Needed through epithelium of intestine, renal tubules, exocrine glands etc
    - Active transport on one side, simple or facilitated diffusions on the other
    
      
    

# Ch 5 Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials

Basic Physics of Mem Pot

- Diffusion of charged ions along [] gradient until prevented by built up _diffusion potential_
    - High [K] inside and high [Na] outside

![[Untitled 45.png]]

- Pot that prevents ne diffusion of an ion = _Nernst potential_
    - Pot = 0 in extracellular fluid, + = ion diffusing = neg

![[Untitled 46.png]]

- For mult ions consider each ion’s permeability + []s
    - + ion [] gradient form in to out = electronegativity inside membrane: anions unable to diffuse out (or negative ion with gradient out to in)

![[Untitled 47.png]]

  

Measuring: -90mV inside nerve fiber

- Only need to create this dipole at the membrane layer, interior has + and - ions —> small # of ions needed

![[Untitled 48.png]]

  

Resting Mem Pot of Nerves: -90mV, pot inside is more negative than in extracellular fluid

- Active Transport via Na+ K+ Pump: Na out, K in; 3:2 ratio —> net - inside; forms large [] gradients
- K+ “leak” channels: allows some K back out of cell, some Na as well (not as permeable)
- Origin of -90
    - K+ alone = -94, Na+ alone = +61 via diffusion through leak channels: via Goldman eq net EMF = -86 (membrane more permeable to K)
    - Pumps account for remaining -4
- In summary, the diffusion potentials alone caused by  
    potassium and sodium diffusion would give a membrane  
    potential of about −86 millivolts, almost all of this being  
    determined by potassium diffusion. Then, an additional  
    −4 millivolts is contributed to the membrane potential by  
    the continuously acting electrogenic Na+-K+ pump, giving  
    a net membrane potential of −90 millivolts

  

Action Potential: rapid changes in membrane pot

- Resting —> Depolarization —> Repolarization : accomplished via voltage gated channels
    - Voltage Gated Na: as membrane begins to depolarize (-70 to -50) activation gate opens AND inactivation gate closes but slower
        - Inactivation gate won’t open until resting potential restored
    - Voltage Gated K: opens due to depolarization but slower, kicks in to help repolarize, closes when resting state is restored

  

![[Untitled 49.png]]

![[Untitled 50.png]]

  

- Other ions:
    - Anions unable to diffuse gives fibers a - charge when there are less + ions present
    - Ca: ~ to Na, pumps + gated channels keep Ca outside cell + contribute to depolarization but much slower
        - Low [Ca] in extracellular fluid makes nerves highly excitable at small changes in mem pot: Ca binds to Na voltage-gated channels and changes threshold for activation
- Initiation of AP: positive feedback of opening Na channels once threshold of 15-30mV increase occurs
- Propagation of AP: influx of Na ions increases mem pot of adjacent fiber areas which go on to produce more AP; all or nothing
- Re-establishing ion gradients: Na K pumps use energy
    - Activity increases w/ high [Na] inside membrane

  

Special Characteristics

- Plateau: slower Ca channels prolong depolarization, K gated channels open _even slower_ than usual
- Repetitive discharge (heart, smooth muscle, neurons) for heart beat, breathe, peristalsis (movement of intestine contents)
    - higher resting pot —> automatic membrane depolarization
    - Na gates always letting ions through eventually leading to AP
    - Near instant depolarization prevented via increased K permeability: membrane becomes hyperpolarized and unable to be re-self-excited for a short period

  

![[Untitled 51.png]]

![[Untitled 52.png]]

  

Nerve Fiber Anatomy

- AP takes place at axon membrane only at nodes of Ranvier
    - Myelin is an insulator
    - AP still propagate via saltatory conduction from node to node: electrical current conducts in axoplasm within + extracellular fluid without fiber
    - Increases velocity of transmission (0.25m/s to 100m/s) + reduces quantity of ions needed for depolarization / repolarization

  

  

  

Excitation: mechanical, chemical, electrical triggers

![[Untitled 53.png]]

- Electrode Stim: cathode + anode, membrane stimulated at anode
    - Applying - current outside fiber reduces the potential across the membrane (outside is now closer to the more negative inside)
    - Cathode causes hyperpolarization
    - Stim at too low voltage produces _acute local potentials_ (_acute subthreshold pot_ if no AP): mem potential still affected by stim
    - Refractory Period: inactivation of Na and K channels until resting pot restored
        - 1/2500 s for large myelinated fibers
- Inhibition: high [Ca] in extracellular fluid as described above, chemicals that makes Na gates harder to open

# Ch 6 Contraction of Skeletal Muscle

![[Untitled 54.png]]

Anatomy

- Fiber: covered by sarcolemma membrane that attaches to tendons
- Fibers —> myofibrils —> myosin + actin filaments that interlock / alternate
    - _sarcoplasm + sarcoplasmic reticulum_ betwixt myofibrils: K, Mg, phosphate, enzymes + mitochondria
- Sarcomere: between z-disks, contracts due to myosin / actin overlapping
    - Thick **myosin** A bands (anisotropic to polarized light): cross-bridges project from side
    - Thin **actin** I bands (isotropic to polarized light): Z-disks on end, attaches to other z-disks across fiber to create striation
    - Myosin + actin held in place vis _titin_: springy protein connect myosin to z-disk

![[Untitled 55.png]]

  

Mech of Contraction

- AP from motor nerve on ends of fibers —> _acetylcholine_ secreted + activates act. gated channels —> Na flows + activates Na gated channel —> resulting AP travels to center of fiber —> sarcoplasmic reticulum releases tons of Ca —> Ca causes actin + myosin to slide along each other —> Ca pumped back into reticulum

  

Molecular Mech of Contraction

- Sliding filaments mechanism: interaction of cross-bridges triggered by Ca release + fueled by ATP
- Myosin Mols: 1.6 um, tail + head structure
    - Cross-bridge: projecting arms + heads of myosin mols
        - Hinges at arm + arm / head jxn for extension from filament + contraction
    - Myosin twists so cross-bridges project in all directions
    - Head has _ATPase_
- Actin 1um
    - Tropomyosin covers active sites during resting state
    - Troponin: affinity for actin, tropomyosin, Ca ions
- Resting: active sites of actin covered by troponin-tropomyosin complex, prevents binding of myosin heads
- Interaction
    - Ca alters complex to inhibit it
    - Myosin heads bind to active sites + contraction! via…
- “walk-along theory”
    - Head attaches + performs a “power stroke” which moves actin filament
    - Then it breaks from active site + extends to bind to new active site
- ATP: Fenn effect, more work by muscle = more ATP cleaved
    - ATP cleaved at head, retains products, extends toward actin
    - Ca uncovers active site + head binds
    - Head performs power stroke using energy products + releases ADP + phosphate
    - ATP binds again + causes head to detach + re-extend to find new active site

![[Untitled 56.png]]

![[Untitled 57.png]]

![[Untitled 58.png]]

![[Untitled 59.png]]

Overlap Mech Affects Muscle Output

- Max tension at 2-2.2 um overlap B
- C: actin begins to overlap
- A: myosin hits z-disks

Contraction of Whole muscle: velocity reduces as load increases

![[Untitled 60.png]]

![[Untitled 61.png]]

  

Energetics of Contraction

- Work = load x distance
    - 25% efficient due to heat loss in making ATP
    - Improves with medium velocity: no lose to maintenance heat or overcoming friction (high speed)
- Energy sources: used for walk-along, pump Ca ions, pump Na + K ions for AP
    - phosphocreatine: high energy bond cleaved to reconstitute ATP
    - Glycolysis in muscle cells: create pyruvic + lactic acids anaerobically + faster than w/ O (but waste products build up)
    - Oxidative metabolism: glycolysis + O to process foodstuffs

  

Whole Muscle Contraction

- Isometric (same length) vs isotonic (same force)
- Muscle contraction varies in length + strength
- Slow v Fast fibers
    - Slow (Type 1, red muscle): smaller, extensive supply network for O from blood, more mitochondria, myoglobin (iron containing —> red!)
    - Fast (Type II, white): larger for more strength, large reticulum for Ca ion release, glycolytic enzymes
- Motor unit: nerve fiber + all muscle fibers it innervates
- Summation
    - Multiple Fiber: weak to strong signals triggers larger + larger motor units, can quickly step up force
    - Freq: individual twitches start before last one ends, when this appears continuous = tetanization
        - Past tetanization Ca ions remain out of reticulum to support contraction constantly
- Strength: 50 psi
    - Initially contraction is weak but increases in a staircase fashion: treppe (may be due to Ca not being reabsorbed quickly enough)
- At test tension or muscle tone due to spinal cord stim
- Fatigue: lack of glycogen
- Muscles as lever systems
    - Strength based on point of insertion, distance to fulcrum, length of lever, position
    - Coactivation of agonist + antagonist muscles: vary ratio of activation
- Muscle remodeling to match fxn
    - Hypertrophy: more actin, myosin filaments + enzymes
    - Sarcomeres added or removed to adjust lengths
    - fiber hyperplasia: rare case of large fibers slitting
- Muscle denervation: fibers replaced by fibrous + fatty tissue that tends to shorten
    - Loss of nerve fibers can be compensated by remaining motor units innervate more fibers —> loss of fine control
- Rigor mortis: no ATP to separate cross bridges

# Ch 7 Excitation of Skeletal Muscle: Neuromuscular Transmission + Excitation-Contraction Coupling

Neuromuscular Jxn

- Motor End plate: attachment of nerve to muscle fiber

![[Untitled 62.png]]

- Acetylcholine
    - Axon terminal: mitochondria to make ATP for acetylcholine production
    - Vesicles released after nerve impulse: voltage gated Ca channels open + Ca ions into nerve trigger vesicles
    - Acetyl. receptors open channels: - charged channel, allows in mostly Na
        - End plate potential formed: + charge in muscle fiber membrane, AP initiated
        - High safety factor: end plate pot >>> threshold for AP
        - 100’s of activations / sec will reduce # of acetyl. vesicles —> fatigue of fxn
    - Synaptic gutter / trough: lots acetylcholinesterase to destroy secreted acetyl.

![[Untitled 63.png]]

  

- Molecular biology: Golgi forms vesicles which are filled with acetyl, after secretion more formed from coated pits in the membrane
- Drugs to enhance / block
    - methacholine, carbachol, nicotine: same effect as acetyl. but it is not dissipated quickly
    - Some drugs inactivate the acetyl. enzyme also causing spasms, others block acetyl. reeptors

  

Muscle AP

- Characteristics: -80 to-90 resting, 1-5ms length (longer than nerves), 3-5 m/s (faster)
- Transmission of AP: transverse tubules penetrate through fibers so Ca can release net to myofibrils

  

Excitation-contraction coupling

- T-tubules extend the cell membrane: AP travel along them to interior of muscle
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum: large chambers of terminal cisternae, long longitudinal tubules surrounding myofibrils
    - Always active Ca pump

![[Untitled 64.png]]

![[Untitled 65.png]]

![[Untitled 66.png]]

# Ch 8 Excitation + Contraction of Smooth Muscle

Types

- Multi-unit: fibers contract indep. + controlled by nerve signals
- Unitary: groups of fibers contracting as one, membranes connected to transmit force (gap jxns)

  

  

  

  

Contractile Mech

- Similar actin + myosin filaments
- Dense bodies between actin filaments
- Cross-bridges: myosin pulls actin filament on each side in opposite directions to contract more of the available length
- Cross-bridges attach to actin longer = greater strength
- Less ATPase activity = low contraction freq, less energy used
- Lower contraction freq, greater strength - cross-bridges attached to actin longer)
- Slow attachment + detachment of cross-bridges: slower start + increased length of contraction
- Latch Mech: much less excitation + energy needed to maintain contraction
- Stress-Relaxation: despite drastic changes in vol, smooth muscle returns to og force (maintain pressure in hollow organs)

  

![[Untitled 67.png]]

![[Untitled 68.png]]

Regulation via Ca

- Ca binds w/ _calmodulin,_ activates myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylates _regulatory chain_ (one light chain of myosin head) which allows binding to actin
- Low [Ca] reverses process: extra enzyme myosin phosphatase needed to split phosphate from regulatory chain
- May explain latch mech: deactivation of these enzymes means myosin heads are attached for greater part of cycling period

  

Nervous Control of Contraction

- Autonomic fibers branch on top of fibers without direct contact —> diffuse junctions
- Excitation travels to lower layers via transmitter substance
- Varicosities in axons aka gaps in Schwann cell to allow secretion
- Some multi-unit has very close varicosities —> contact jxns, much faster contraction
- Acetylcholine or norepinephrine: excites or inhibits the fibers depending on receptor type

![[Untitled 69.png]]

- Membrane + AP: -50 to -60 mV, Ap usually only in unitary
    - Two types
        - Spike Potentials: typical AP, triggered by variety of inputs (electric, hormones, stretch etc)
        - AP w/ Plateaus: delayed repolarization —> prolonged contraction
    - AP due to primarily slower Ca channels vs Na
    - Slow wave of membrane pot: part of smooth muscle properties
        - Possibly due to varying ion pump activity
        - Triggers AP when strong enough
    - Stretch —> spontaneous AP: decrease in membrane negativity from stretch

![[Untitled 70.png]]

- Multi-unit smooth muscle: fibers too small to generate AP, nerve transmitter spreads “electronically” over entire fiber

  

Hormonal Control of Contraction

- Local tissue chem factors: lack of O, extra CO2, extra [H] —> vasodilation
- Hormones: norepinephrine, epinephrine, acetyl. oxytocin. etc
    - Excites or inhibits depending on receptors
    - Excitation: opening Na or Ca channels
    - Inhibit: close channels or open K channels
    - Sometimes effect happens w/o changing mem pot, instead Ca could be directly released: receptors activate enzymes that change phosphorylation of enzymes that typically inhibit contraction

  

Source of Ca Ions

- Ca ions stored in extracellular fluid + diffuses through channels from there: 200-300ms
- Some larger smooth muscle cells have some sarcoplasmic reticulum around invaginations of membrane _caveolae_
- Strength of contraction deps on [Ca]
- Ca mump (slower than in skeletal muscle) needed for relaxation

  

  

# Ch 46 Sensory Receptors, Neuronal Circuits for Processing Information

Types of Sensory Receptors

- Mechano, thermo, nociceptors (pain), electromagnetic, chemoreceptors
- Each is differentially sensitive to one type of stimuli
- Nerve fibers transmit one modality of sensation = labeled line principle
- Linkage point to nervous system determines what is communicated via the nerve impulses

  

Transduction of Stimuli to Nerve Impulses

- Stimuli changes the receptor membrane pot due to change in permeability
- Above a receptor pot threshold APs happen (higher level = higher freq)
- Intense stim = less and less increase in number of AP: sensitive to weak input but not max out until presented with extreme stim
- Adaptation: w/ continuous stim receptor responds at high rate first then progressively slows
    - All do it, time frame varies as does the mech: some structural adjustment + electrical accommodation
    - Ex: pacinian corpuscle redistributes viscous fluid + tip of the fiber _accommodates_ to stim
    - Slowly adapting _tonic_ receptors: transmit for a while when stim is present i.e. Golgi tendon apparatus for muscle contraction
    - Rate / movement / phasic receptors: react during a change
        - Used to predict next state of body i.e. vestibular adjustments + coordination when running

  

Nerve Fiber Types

![[Untitled 71.png]]

- 0.2-20nm diameter; velocity 0.5-120m/s
- A: medium-large, myelinated vs C: small unmyelinated
- Groups
    - 1a: ends of muscle spindles
    - 1b: Golgi tendon
    - II: discrete cutaneous tactile, flower-spray muscle endings
    - III: temp, crude touch, prickling pain
    - IV: pain, itch, crude touch

  

Summation

- Increase sim strength = more fibers or increased frequency of nerve impulses

  

Transmission + Processing in Neuronal Pools: unique organization for specific sig processing

- input fibers terminate on multiple neurons (less on further neurons) —> stimulatory field
- Lots of terminals need to discharge for excitation:
    - Input fiber 1 is a excitatory / superthreshold stim to A
    - To B/C it is a subthreshold (facilitates future excitation)

![[Untitled 72.png]]

- Same principle for inhibition signaling
- Divergence: weak signals into a pool —> excites many output fibers
    
    ![[Untitled 73.png]]
    
- Multiple inputs to a single neuron : spatial summation, summation of info
    
    ![[Untitled 74.png]]
    
- _reciprocal inhibition circuit_: excitation + inhibition outputs via intermediate inhibitory neuron
- Afterdischarge: prolonged output of signal into a pool
    - Synaptic afterdischarge: electronic pot change lingers
    - Reverberatory / oscillatory circuit: positive feedback to re-excite input with levels of complexity / delay
        - Initial high signal that decrease to a critical point: fatigue of synaptic jxns = stimulation < threshold
- Continuous Output w/o excitatory input sig
    - Cont. intrinsic : neurons w/ naturally high mem pot, rate can be modulated
    - Cont. reverberatory: reverberating circuit where fatigue doesn’t stop continued oscillation, modulate intensity via excitation / inhibition signals
- Rhythmic Output: due to reverberating circuits or series of them

  

Stability

- Inhibitory circuits:
    - Feedback circuits to the initial excitatory neurons of pathways
    - Gross inhibition of areas of brain
- Synaptic fatigue: weaker transmission w/ longer + more intense excitation
- Alter sensitivity via regulation of receptor proteins: excess of transmitter substance binds to receptors + inactivates them

# Ch 9 Cardiac Muscle; The Heart as a Pump and Fxn of Heart Valves

![[Untitled 75.png]]

Cardiac Muscle

- Atrial, ventricular —> contraction excitatory (automatic rhythmic discharge), conductive
- Syncytium: intercalcated discs connect muscle cells, excitation spreads throughout all cells
    - Atrial + ventricular syncytium: conduction betwixt via A-V bundle
- AP: -85 to 20, longer plateau: slow Ca-Na channels + decreased permeability to K (slower repolarization)
    - 0.3-0.5m/s: faster than large nerves + skeletal muscle
    - Refractory period: 0.25-0.3 of plateau + additional 0.05 where muscle takes a strong signal to excite
- Excitation-Contraction coupling: Ca from sarcoplasmic reticulum AND Ca from T tubules themselves; both pumped back w/ Ca-ATPase pumps
    - Most of contraction strength comes from this, larger tubules than skeletal muscle
    - _remember_ : T tubules connect to extracellular fluid

  

Cardiac Cycle

- Generation of AP from sinus node, delay of impulse from atria to ventricles

![[Untitled 76.png]]

- Diastole: relaxation + filing, Systole: contraction
- HR: 1/HR = cycle duration; faster rate means cardiac chambers don’t fill all the way
- Waves:
    - P = spread of depolarization through atria
    - QRS = depolarization of ventricles
    - T = repolarization of ventricles
- Atria: primer pumps, 80% flows in, 20% from contraction
    - a wave from contraction, c from backflow + valve bulge, _ v from slow blood flow into atria w/ closed valves
- Ventricle pumps
    - Filling during diastole: rapid fill, continued slow flow direct from veins, contraction + final influx
    - Isometric contraction: pressure + tension increase, little shortening of fibers
    - Ejection (80 mmHg left, 8mm right): first third = rapid ejection (70%) then slow ejection
    - Isovolumic relaxation: aortic + pulmonary valves close from blood pushback
    - Volumes: end diastolic (after filling), stroke vol output (ejection amount), end-systolic (remaining amount)
        - ejection fraction = stroke vol output / end diastolic

- Valves
    - A-V valves (tricuspid + mitral): prevent backflow into atria
    - semilunar (aortic + pulmonary artery): prevent arterial backflow,
        - Heavier pressure needed, more mech force
    - Papillary muscles: prevent bulging of valves that could cause leaking
    - Aortic Pressure: increase till ventricular pressure forces it open, decrease as blood flows out, slight increase due to backflow during close, pressure falls

![[Untitled 77.png]]

- Sounds: vanes closing leading to vibration, A-V then semilunar valves

Work Output: energy to work

- volume-pressure / external work: move blood from low to high pressure (veins to arteries)
- kinetic energy of blood flow: accelerate to ejection velocity
- Left ventricle: 6x pressure, 6x the work
- Diastolic pressure: filling till before ventricles contract
    - >150 rapid increase at limits of tissue stretch
- Systolic pressure: contraction
    - >150-170ml rapid decrease, muscle fibers stretched past optimal lengths

![[Untitled 78.png]]

- Volume-pressure diagram
    
    - Filling I —> isovolumic contraction: all valves closed —> ejection: aortic valve opens —> isovlumic relaxation
    - Area = net external work output
    
      
    

![[Untitled 79.png]]

- Preload (tension at start of contraction) + Afterload (load muscle works against) of muscle
    - Preload = end-diastolic pressure
    - Afterload = pressure in aorta, systolic pressure at Phase III
    - Altered during abnormal states

  

Chemical Energy for Contraction: O use

- Mostly oxidative metabolism of fatty acids: relate O consumption to chemical energy use as well as EW
- O consumption related to… tension during contraction x duration = tension time index
    - High tensions at high systolic pressure + large ventricle diameters
- Efficiency 20-25% (heat loss)

  

Regulation of Pumping

- Intrinsic Regulation: Frank-Starling mech
    - More stretch = more contraction:
        - Actin/myosin filaments stretched to more optimal overlap
        - Stretch of right atrial wall increases heart rate
    - Stroke work increases with pressure
    - Ventricular output increases with pressure
- Nervous System
    - Sympathetic: increases rate + force 2-3x
        - inhibition = moderate decrease to pumping: constant 30% stimulation level
    - Parasympathetic: reduce rate, vagal fibers go to atria

![[Untitled 80.png]]

- Ion regulation
    - K: excess slows rate, weakens, dilates
        - Reducing membrane potential, reduced AP strength
    - Ca excess: spastic contraction
- Temperature: directly proportional
    - Heat increases permeability of muscle to ions
    - Limited strength increase initially
- Pressure: no increase in out put due to arterial pressure till beyond normal levels
    - Flow determined by venous return, ease of flow from tissues

# Ch 10 Rhythmical Excitation of the Heart

Regular Impulses + Rapid Conduction

- Sinus (Sinoatrial Node): connects directly to atrial muscle fibers
    - Automatic rhythmicity: naturally leaky fibers to Na + Ca, resting pot = -55
        - Fast Na channels, slow Na-Ca, K channels: at -55 Na channels inactive
    - High [Na] and constantly open channels = constant rise in resting mem pot —> at 40 Na-Ca open + AP!
    - Hyperpolarization: Na-Ca inactive + lots of K ions diffuse out
- Special bands of conductive fibers allow for rapid conduction
- Delay from atria to ventricle: A-V node
    - Less gap jxns betwixt cells
    - Purkinje fibers: larger fast transmitting fibers , permeable gap jxns
        - 0.03 seconds once entering these fibers to cover whole heart
    - One-way excitation
    - Elsewhere conduction prevented by fibrous barrier
- Transmission to Muscle via fibers: 0.3-0.5m/s: 0.03 seconds

![[Untitled 81.png]]

![[Untitled 82.png]]

![[Untitled 83.png]]

- Slows at A-V node + from ventricular muscle to epicardial surface

  

Control of Excitation / Conduction

- Sinus Node = pacemaker (70-80 / min), A-V (40-60), Purkinje fibers (15-40)
    - Sinus discharges faster before the other fibers
    - “ectopic” pacemaker: abnormal contraction due to faster than normal excitation or blockage of impulses form sinus node
    - A-V blockage: ventricular stim will happen due to Purkinje fibers at their rate, period of failure to pump blood due to over drive = fainting
- Purkinje system = ventricular mass contracts effectively all together
- Nervous control
    - Parasympathetic: acetylcholine release
        - Decrease sinus rate + excitability of A-V jxntial fibers
        - Increases permeability to K - hyperpolarization, longer for AP to develop
    - Sympathetic: norepinephrine, stimulates receptors (maybe by increasing permeability to Na + Ca [would account for contraction strength increase])
        
        - Increase sinus node, conduction, excitability, force of contraction
        
          
        

Interesting how much of different electrical patterns is due to channel characteristics

- Extended plateau of cardiac muscle potential : slower Ca channels
- Rhythmic discharge of sinus node to control heart: leaky channels
- So much depends on low level structures, what else can go wrong if these channels act up?
    - No heart beat, spastic muscles

  

# Ch 14 Overview of the Circulation; Biophysics of Pressure, Flow, and Resistance

Physical Characteristics

- Parts
    - systemic and pulmonary circulation
    - Arteries: high pressure blood to tissue
    - Arterioles: small branches of ^
    - Capillaries: fluid transfer betwixt blood + intracellular fluid
    - Venules: collect blood from ^, turns into larger…
    - Veins: blood to heart, stores extra blood
- Veins have larger cross section, slower flow
- Pressures: aorta 120/80 (systoli / diastole)

![[Untitled 84.png]]

Basic Fxn

- Rate of flow to tissues = exactly what’s needed: local control of microvessels based on needed substances + waste build up
- Cardiac output dictated by sum of local tissue flow: heart responds to tissue demand
- Arterial pressure kept at 100 mmHg ind. of local flow or cardiac output control

  

Pressure, Flow, Resistance

- Flow = Ohm’s law: Flow = ΔP / R
    - 5000 ml/min = total flow / cardiac output
    - Flowmeters: voltage produced by flow through magnetic field OR ultrasonic dopler (lower freq returned waves)
    - Laminar flow w/ parabolic profile (mols stick to walls)
    - Turbulence due to… obstacle, turn, rough surface
        - avg vel x diam. x density / viscosity
            
            ![[Untitled 85.png]]
            
- Pressure: mm Hg = 1.36 cm H2O
    - Rapid changes recorded w/ fluid membrane that moves an electrical part for recording
- Resistance: can’t be measured directly, 1 peripheral resistance unit = 1/1 =ΔP / R
    - Systemic: 100/100 = 1 PRU, can range from 0.2-4
    - Pulmonary = 0.14 PRU (ΔP = 16-2)
- Conductance: 1/R, measure of flow at given ΔP
    - C α Diam^4: due to laminar flow - small vessels = more sticking to walls
        
        ![[Untitled 86.png]]
        
    - Small changes in arterioles can drastically change flow to tissues
- Networks: R in series + // follows resistor rules
- Viscosity: x3 of water due to red blood cells dragging
    - Hematocrit: proportion of RBC; increases cause drastic ^ in viscosity
- Blood flow autoregulation: tissues maintain normal flow despite change in arterial pressure
    - Any increase/dec in P = increase/dec in R
    - Changes can come from constriction via sympathetic stim or hormones (norepinephrine, vasopressin)
        - Even with this autoregulation eventually takes over
- Passive Pres.-Flow relationship: increase P = less R, distends (Swells) elastic vessels
    - Flow stops below _critical closing pressure_
    - Sympathetic stim can constrict to zero, inhibition dilates vessels to increase flow

  

==How does sympathetic inhibition effect blood flow==

# Ch 15 Vascular Distensibility and Functions of the Arterial and Venous Systems

All vessels are distensible (swell in reaction to pressure)

- Stronger arterial walls → veins x8 more distensible

![[Untitled 87.png]]

- Compliance: total blood that can be stored
    
    - Also = distensibility x vol
    
    ![[Untitled 88.png]]
    
- Sympathetic stim = ^ muscle tone → ^ pressure
    - Can compensate for blood loss of 20-25%

![[Untitled 89.png]]

- Delayed Compliance: increase in volume causes initial stretching, then smooth muscle fibers “creep” to longer lengths + reduce their tension, pressure goes down
    - Allows adjustment for large blood influx / loss

  

Arterial Pressure Pulsations

- Distensibility → pulsations almost entirely cease in tissue / capillaries
- Pulse pressure = stroke vol output / arterial compliance: more pressure to pump more blood / less compliant → greater rise in pressure

- Abnormal Contours
    - aortic valve stenosis: AValve opening reduced, less pressure since output flow is less
    - patent ductus arteriosus: blood into aorta flows into pulmonary artery + lung vessels, diastolic pressure falls
    - aortic regurgitation: Avalve absent or doesn’t close all the way, backflow into left ventricle, aortic pressure can fall to 0 bewixt beats
        - No sharp incisura pattern, valuve doesn’t close

![[Untitled 90.png]]

- Transmission of Pressure Pulse: ^ compliance = slower speed, faster travel in smaller distal arteries
    - Damping = R x Compliance: harder to move next segment x greater quantity of blood to change pressure

  

Measuring Systolic + Diastolic P: auscultatory method (10% error)

- Close artery + listen for Korotkoff sounds
- Tapping sounds = systolic: blood slips through artery
- Sounds become muffled / disappear: diastolic
- Values increase with age: kidney fxn + atherosclerosis “hardening of arteries” (less compliant, higher pressure needed)
- Average arterial pressure: due to 60% diastolic pres. 40% systolic

  

Veins

- Pressure: systemic veins flow to right atrium, right atrial pressure = central venous pres.
    - Dictated by pumping ability (weak pump = higher pressure) + blood influx from veins (more input = more pressure)
    - Normally 0 mmHg: range -3/-5 (strong pump or largely reduced flow ) to 20/30 (heart failure, large transfusion)
- Large veins: typically 0 resistance but compression at various points = some 4-6 mmHg > right atrial pres.
- ^ right atrial pres.: backup of blood in veins causes enlargement, above +4/6 mmHg the actual pressure rises
- Intra-abdominal pressure ^ → pres. in leg veins must go above this point for flow back to heart

- Gravitational pressure: weight of water / blood
    - Neck veins = almost always 0 mmHg, collapse close to skull bc of pres. on exterior of neck: any increase opens the veins + decrease = veins move and ^ resistance
    - Skull veins cannot collapse: negative pressures
    - Applies to arterial pres. too: 100 mmHg measured at heart
- Venous pump: one way valves + muscle movement squeezes blood from veins
    - Standing still → ^ venous pres. → capillaries leak fluid to tissue spaces

![[Untitled 91.png]]

- Varicose Veins: stretching of veins prevents valves from completely closing
    - Veins protrude, edema, painful muscles

  

Measuring Venous Pressure

- Visual distention of veins, catheter
- Ref. level for pres. measurement: heart prevents large gravitational pressure changes
    - ^ in pressure = ventricles fill more to increase pumping
    - Decrease = right ventricle doesn’t fill all the way, blood backs up in veins until pressure goes up

![[Untitled 92.png]]

Blood Reservoir Fxn of Veins

- Blood loss → pres. sensors in circulatory sys trigger sympathetic nerves to veins to cause constriction
- Specific reservoirs: spleen (100ml), liver (several hundred ml), large abdominal veins, venous plexus under skin, heart (50-100), lungs (100-200)

- Spleen:
    - Venous sinuses: swells like rest of venous sys to store blood
    - Pulp: permeable capillaries → RBC trapped in trabecular mesh of red pulp , plasma continues to vinous sinuses
        - 50mL of concentrated RBC
    - Blood cells killed here: can’t withstand trauma of squeezing through sinuses
    - Reticuloendothelial cells clean blood of bacteria, debris, etc.

# Ch 16 The Microcirculation and Lymphatic System: Capillary Fluid Exchange, Interstitial  
Fluid, and Lymph Flow

- Transport of nutrients to tissue + removal of cell excreta

  

Structure

- Arteries branch 6-8 → arterioles 2-5 branches → blood to cap.
- Metarterioles: fibers intermittently encircle vessel, fiber where capillary branches = _precapillary sphincter_

- Capillary wall: 0.5 um thickness, internal diameter = 4-9 um
- Pores: intercellular cleft - channel betwixt adj. endothelial cells → rapid diffusion of water soluble ions + small solutes
    - Brain: tight jxns alone small mols only
    - Liver: wide clefts
    - GI tract: betwixt muscle + liver pores
    - Kidney: small oval windows to let small mols filter through

![[Untitled 94.png]]

  

Blood flow in Capillaries

- Vasomotion: intermittent contraction of metarterioles + precap. sphincters
- Regulation: [O] in tissue, ^ freq of contractions in response to low []
- For a tissue bed, capillary fxn discussed in terms of averages: rate of blood / substance transfer, pres.

  

Exchange of Substances Betwixt Blood + Interstitial Fluid

- Diffusion due to random thermal motion
    - Lipid soluble subst. go through cell membranes
    - Others go through pores via rapid thermal motion
- Permeability of pores depends on diameter + tissue type (liver = super permeable)
- Net rate deps on [gradient]: large rates of diffusion = small [] dif needed

  

Interstitium: collagen fiber bundles + proteoglycan filaments

- Gel: proteoglycan filaments + fluid; fluid diffuses vs flows through
- Rivulets of free fluid + fluid vesicles: expands in edema

  

  

![[Untitled 95.png]]

Fluid Filtration Factors

- Starling Forces
    - Capillary Pressure Pc: push fluid out of cap.
    - Interstitial fluid pres. Pif: fluid into cap. when +
    - Plasma colloid osmotic pres. Πp: osmosis of fluid into cap.
    - Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pres. Πif: osmosis out of cap.

![[Untitled 96.png]]

- Net Filtration Pressure = + for fluid filtration out of cap
    
    ![[Untitled 97.png]]
    
- Capillary filtration coef. K_f: measure of capacity of cap. to filter water at given NFP (depends on quant. + size of pores)
    
    ![[Untitled 98.png]]
    
- Capillary Hydrostatic Pre.: 25 mmHg, 17
    - Cannulation: micropipette, various readings depending on tissue
    - Functional measure: decrease arterial, ^ venous pres. till no more fluid movement occurs
        - Lower than direct measure since some fluid reabsorption is handled by lymph not capil.
- Inter. Fluid Hydrostatic Pre.
    - Measured via direct cannulation, implanted perforated capsules, pres. from a cotton wick in tissues
    - Pres. in tightly encased tissue (cranial vault, fibrous tissue): + readings but less than that of pres. on outside of tissues from encasements
        - Normal int. fluid pres. is < that of pres. of surrounding tissue
    - Pres. in loose subcutaneous tissue = ~-3 mmHg; due to lymphatic cap. contracting + pumping fluid in t circulation
- Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pres.: ~28 mmHg, 19 from mol. effects, 9 from Donnan effect (extra pres. from cations held in plasma by proteins)
    - Due to proteins of plasma = int. fluids
    - Osmotic pressure based on # of mols not mass: albumin mostly contributes
- Int. Fluid Colloid Osmotic Pres.
    - Small amounts of proteins leak into int. via pores + small vesicles
    - Quant. in int. slightly > in plasma but 4x volume → 8 mmHg, lower []
- Exchange of fluid through cap. Membrane
    - Arterial pres. > venous: filtration out of cap. at arterial end, reabsorption at venous end
    - Arterial end: 15 mmHg outward
    - Venous: 7 mmHg inward (less since venous cap. are more numerous + permeable)
        - 9/10 reabsorbed, rest into lymph

- Starling Eq
    - Effectively net flow out + in is about equally
    - 0.3 mmHg net outward to int → 2 ml/ min.: compensated for by lymph
    - Filtration Coef: 6.67 ml/min of fluid / mmHg for entire body
        - / 100 g of any tissue: various widely
        - Protein [] also vary

![[Untitled 99.png]]

- Pressure imbalances: mean cap. pressure = 17 mmHg
    - Above this → huge increase in flow to int., overwhelms lymphatic sys.
    - Too low, blood volume increase from flow into cap.

  

Lymphatic System

![[Untitled 100.png]]

- Carries proteins + large substances back to blood: 2-3 L / day
    - Tissues have lymph channels or prelymphatics that drain fluid from int.
    - Lower + left side feeds into _thoracic duct_, right side goes into R lymph duct

- Lymph Capillaries
    - Int. fluid pushes subst. through values + backflow closes them
    - Valves at terminal ends + along larger lymphatic vessels
- Lymph in thoracic duct combines from all areas: 3-5 g/dl protein
    - initially it matches int. [] 2g/dl but combines with higher [] from liver + intestines
    - Bacteria also enters but is destroyed at lymph nodes

![[Untitled 101.png]]

- Rate of Flow: 120 ml / hr (100ml in thoracic duct, 20 rest of circulation)
    
    - ^ int. fluid pres. → ^ lymph flow: more fluid into int.
        - ^. cap. hydrostsatic. pres. or int. fluid colloid osmotic pres. or cap. permeabiliyt OR decreased plasma colloid osmotic pres.
    - 1-2 mmHg above atmospheric pres. (0) tissue pressure → compressing of larger lymphatics that impedes flow
    
    ![[Untitled 102.png]]
    
    - Lymphatic pump: segments betwixt valves contract when filled pushing fluid along
        - Pumping also due to… skeletal muscle contraction, movement, pulsations of nearby arteries, compression of tissue ; increases during exercise
        - At terminal ends: ^ pres. closes overlapping valve flaps causing pressure to push lymph forward
        - Cap. endothelial cell contraction: some contain actomyosin filaments
    - **rate = interstitial fluid pres. x activity of lymphatic pump**
- Control of Int. Protein [], fluid, pres.
    - Int. fluid protein [] increases to a thres. → ^ int. fluid vol. + pres. → return of protein + fluid to lymphatics increases to balance
    - Steady state of all factors
- Neg. Int. fluid pres.: holds tissues together via partial vacuum in areas w/o connective fibers

  

  

# Ch 26 The Urinary System: Functional Anatomy  
and Urine Formation by the Kidneys

_Why don’t nephrons regenerate? Reduction of fxn with age_

Functions: homeostasis!

- Primary: remove wastes + control vol. / electrolyte compositions of fluids
    - Waste products: urea, creatinine, uric acid (NA), hemoglobin breakdown, hormone breakdown; toxins
    - Adjust excretion to match large variations in intake for… water, Na, Cl, K, Ca, H, Mg
- Arterial Pres. Regulation: excrete Na / water + secret hormones / vasoactive substances
- Acid-Base Regul: excrete acid, control body fluid buffer
- Erythrocyte Production: stimulates RBC production in bone marrow
- Production of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D_3 or calcitriol: Ca deposition + absorption
- Glucose Synthesis: produced from AA during fasting - gluconeogenesis

  

Anatomy of Kidneys

![[Untitled 103.png]]

- General Organization
    - Hilum: indented region, input / output for vein, artery, lymphatics etc
    - Surrounded by fibrous capsule
    - Outer cortex + inner medulla
    - Calyx, pelvis, ureter → contractile elements toward bladder

- Renal Blood Supply: regulate hydrostatic pressure to control glomerular filtration + tubular reabsorption
    
    - Arteries branch down to _glomerular capillaries_
        - high hydrostatic pres. → rapid filtration
    - Ends coalesce into _efferent arteriole_ + branch to _peritubular caps._
        - Low pres. → reabsorption
    - Peritubular Caps feed back into veins
    
      
    
      
    

![[Untitled 104.png]]

- Nephron - Fxn Unit for forming urine
    - 800,000-1 mil: Cannot regenerate
    - Glomerular caps → _glomerulus_ (filter fluid from blood )_+ tubule_ (convert to urine)
    - Filtered fluid from glomerulus → Bowman’s capsule → Loop of Henle (descend, thin ascend, thick ascend) → region of specialized epithelial cells _macula densa →_ various tubules
        - ~250 collecting ducts for ~4k nephrons

![[Untitled 105.png]]

- Cortical vs Juxtamedullary Nephrons
    - Cortical: short loops of Henle, tubules surrounded by peritubular caps.
    - Juxtamedullary: long penetrating loops of Henle, efferent arteries extend + divide into _vasa recta_ - peritubular capillaries that extend into medulla along loops of Henle

![[Untitled 106.png]]

  

Micturition: emptying in two steps - filling until tension threshold → micturition reflex (autonomic but can be modulated by cerebral cortex / brain stem)

- Anatomy of Bladder
    - Body + neck (lower portion = _posterior urethra_)
    - Body
        - Smooth detrusor muscle → ^ pres. for emptying
        - Trigone region: smooth mucosa
    - Neck: 2-3cm
        - Internal sphincter: prevents emptying
        - Urogenital diaphragm: external sphincter of skeletal muscle
    - Innervation
        - Pelvic nerves: sensory + motor fibers
            - Sensory: detect stretch
            - Motor: parasympathetic
            - Sympathetic innervation via hypogastric nerves: blood vessels

![[Untitled 107.png]]

![[Untitled 108.png]]

- Transport of Urine from Kidney, through Ureters, into Bladder
    - Composition of urine from bladder = that leaving collecting ducts
    - Urine flows to renal calyces → stretches them → increases pacemaker activity → peristaltic contractions
    - Ureters: 25-35 cms
        - Contraction enhanced by parasympathetic stim, inhibited by sympathetic
    - Ureters enter bladder: runs along wall, compressed to prevent backflow
        - _vesicoureteral reflux_: ureter doesn’t run as far, incomplete occlusion → backflow → enlargement of ureters + damaging pres. ^
        - Pres. increases slowly till > 3000-400 mL: pressure waves due to micturition reflex
- Pain sensation: constriction stimulates pain fibers
    - sympathetic _ureterorenal reflex_: constricts renal arterioles, reduce urine output when ureters are blocked

  

Micturition Reflex: stretch reflex

- Sensory signals: to spinal cord via pelvic nerves → back to bladder via parasympathetic fibers
- Cycle: progressive + rapid pres. ^ → sustained pres. (contraction stimulates stretch receptors more) → return to basal tone (fatigue)
    - No emptying: reflex is inhibited for mins-hour → will occur more frequently + stronger
- Past a threshold: reflex triggers through pudendal nerves to relax external sphincter
- Control by the Brain: inhibits micturition, prevent emptying via contraction of ext. sphincter, initiate micturition reflex voluntarily
    - brain stem (pons) region inhibits + facilitates
    - Cerebral cortex: mainly inhibits
    - Voluntary urination: abdominal muscles put pressure on bladder neck + urethra
        - Excite micturition reflex + inhibit ext. sphincter
- Abnormalities
    - Destroyed sensory fibers: overflow incontinence
    - SCI above Sacral: reflexes occur uncontrolled by brain
        - Initially reflex suppressed w/o facilitation from CNS
        - Reflex can return once natural excitability ^: periodic but unannounced emptying
    - Uninhibited neurogenic bladder: lack of inhibition → continual reflex

  

Urine Formation: Glomerular Filtration, Tubular Reabsorption, Tubular Secretion

- Excretion = filtration = reabsorption + secretion rates
- Urine Formation: filtered fluid from glomerular cap. → Bowman’s capsule → tubules…
    - Passes through
    - Partially reabsorbed into blood: Na, Cl
    - Totally reabsorbed: AA, glucose
    - More of substance secreted: organic acids + bases

![[Untitled 109.png]]

- Filtration, reabsorption, secretion of various substances
    - Generally reabsorption matters more than secretion
    - Secretion important for K, H ions in urine
    - Each process is regulated according to the body’s need: filtration / reabsorption rates are large relative to excretion
- Why filter then reabsorb?
    - Rapid removal of products that only excrete via glomerular filtration
    - Body fluids processed multiple times a day

  

# Ch 27 Glomerular Filtration, Renal Blood Flow, and Their Control

Glomerular Filtration

- Filtration of fluid through glomerular cap. into Bowman’s caps. (180 L/day)
    - Most reabsorbed, 1L excreted
- Composition of Filtrate: protein + RBC free, similar to plasma
- Rate = 20% of plasma flow
    - Determined by pres. balance of hydrostatic + osmotic, capillary filtration coef. Kf (permeability + SA of caps.)

- Cap. Membrane:
    - 3 layers, all have negative charges that hinder proteins
        - Endothelium: small holes, fenetrae
        - Basement Mem.: collagen + protoglycan fiber mesh with many large spaces
        - Epithelial Cells (podocytes): footlike processes(pedicels) w/ gaps _slit pores_
    - Thicker but more porous
    - Filterability decreases as mol. weight ^ + with negatively charged mols
- Minimal-change Nephropathy: ^ permeability to plasma proteins, flatted podocytes (feet detached)
    - May be auto-immune related

![[Untitled 110.png]]

Determinants of GFR: = net pres. x Kf

- Net Pres.
    - Hydrostatic pres. in cap.: promotes filtration
    - Hydrostatic Pres. in BC: opposes filtration
    - Colloid osmotic pres. of Cap.: opposes filtration
    - Colloid osmotic ‘’ in BC: promotes filtration

![[Untitled 111.png]]

- Kf: much higher than in other tissues (4.2 mL / min / mmHg / 100g vs 0.01)
- BC Hydrostatic Pres.: ^ = lower GFR
- Glomerular Cap. Colloid Osmotic Pres.
    - Depends on arterial plasma. col. osmotic pres. AND filtration fraction
        - Increase in either → decreased GFR
    - ^ RBF → Fluid filtered out concentrates plasma proteins: ^ renal blood flow → slower rise in glom. cap. colloid osmotic pres. → ^ GFR than normal
- Glomerular Hydrostatic Pres.: primary regulation method
    - Arterial Pres.: ^ → ^ GFR, buffered by auto regulation

![[Untitled 112.png]]

- ^ afferent resistance: reduce pres. + GFR
- Constriction of efferent arterioles: generally reduces GFR (^ resistance)
    - Severe constriction → reduced renal blood flow → ^ in colloid osmotic pres. that overcomes any increase → GFR goes down [3x increase in resistance needed]
    - Modest constriction → ^ GFR

  

Renal Blood Flow: extremely high to allow for high GFR

- Oxygen Consumption: kidneys receive way more than needed for metabolism alone, needed for Na reabsorption
- **Factors of RBF: (renal artery pres. - vein pres.) / total vascular resistance**
    - Resistance: interlobular arteries, afferent + efferent arterioles
        - ^ → reduce RBF
        - Controlled via sympathetic, hormones, local control
- Autoregulation: RBF + GFR maintained over arterial pres. range 80-170 mmHg
- Most RBF goes to cortex: medulla supplied by _vasa recta_

  

Physiological Control of GFR: modulate glomerular hydrostatic pres.

- Sympathetic: strong activation → constricts arterioles → lowers RBF + GFR

- Hormonal + Autacoid:
    - Substances that cause decrease → vasoconstrictors
    - Similar to nervous control, strong activation of sympathetics needed

![[Untitled 113.png]]

- Angiotensin II:
    - Little effect on afferent arterioles → vasodilators counter
    - Efferent arterioles highly affected: ^ angiotensin → ^ hydrostatic pres. + lower RBF
        - Works to prevent decrease in hydrostatic pres. + GFR
        - Reduction in RBF → ^ reabsorption of H2O+ Na
- Endothelial-derived nitric oxide: reduces resistance → lowers GFR
- Prostaglandins + bradykinin: vasodilators → ^ RBF → ^ GFR
    - opposes vasoconstriction factors (sympathetics or angiotensin) to hinder extreme reductions in GFR + RBF

  

Autoregulation of GFR + RBF:

- Maintain near constant GFR + control excretion of H2O + solutes
    - Prevents large changes in GFR that would highly ^ urine volume + deplete blood vol
    - Mechs. cause tubules to ^ reabsorption when GFR ^
    - Arterial pres. still affects H2O + Na excretion: _pressure diuresis_ / _pressure natriuresis_

  

Tubuloglomerular Feedback

- Mech links change in [Na] At macula densa w/ control of arteriolar resistance + GFR autoregulation
    - Constant Na to distal tubule + as a result GFR + RBF

- Afferent arteriolar + efferent arteriolar feedback at the _juxtaglomerular complex_
    - Macula densa senses change in Na Cl delivery to distal tubules
    - Reduced GFR → decrease [NaCl]…
        - Lowered resistance to BF in afferent arterioles → ^ hydrostatic pressure → lowers GFR
        - Renin release from juxtaglomerular cells in both arterioles
            - Angiotensin II produced to constrict efferents → ^ glom. hydrostatic pres. (by preventing it’s reduction) → increase GFR
- Blocking angiotensin II action or formation → helpful for hypertension but most ensure drastic decreases in GFR don’t happen
    
      
    

![[Untitled 114.png]]

![[Untitled 115.png]]

  

- Myogenic Autoregulation: vessels resist stretching when arterial pres. ^
    - Stretching → more Ca ions move into cells → contraction

  

Abnormalities: all about Na to distal tube that then affects RBF + GFR

- High protein diet → ^ RBG + GFR
    - More AA reabsorbed in proximal tubules: co transport → more Na too
    - Triggers autoregulation feedback to decrease afferent arteriole resistance → ^ RBG and GFR
        - higher Na excretion to compensate
- Diabetes mellitus: glucose reabsorbed w/ Na
- GFR declines w/ age: nitric oxide deficient, loss of nephrons
    - Men have higher RBF + GFR but lose it faster

  

# Ch 33 RBC, Anemia, and Polycythemia

_Why do we need RBC? Efficiency, hemoglobin would leak_

RBC: erythrocytes

- Fxn
    - Transport hemoglobin + thus O
    - Carbonic anhydrase enables H2O in blood to move CO2
    - Acid-base buffer
- Shape / Size: biconcave disks, 7.8 um diameter
    - Shape can change as it squeezes through capillaries, excess cell membrane prevents rupture
    - 5.2 mil men, 4.7 women
- Hemoglobin: 34g/100mL of cell fluid = metabolic limit
    - Hematocrit (% of blood that’s RBC) = 40-45%
- Production
    - Initially in yolk sac → liver (spleen, lymph)
    - Bone marrow: past 20 years long bones stop, membranous bones (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, ilia) continue but rate slows

- Genesis of RBC
    - mulitpotent hematopoietic stem cell
        - Some remain in blood
    - Others become committed stem cells
    - Growth + reproduction controlled via protein _growth inducers_: interleukin-3
    - _differentiation inducers_ control type
    - These factors are controlled outside of marrow

![[Untitled 116.png]]

- Differentiation Stages
    - proerythroblast divide many times
    - Basophil erythroblasts: stain with dyes
    - Polychromatophil: hemoglobin appears
        - Hemoglobin continues to fill
        - Nucleus shrinks, it + ER are absorbed or extruded
    - Reticulocyte: some basophilic organelles remain
        - Squeezed out into blood caps. _diapedesis_
    - Remaining material disappears
- Regulation of Production: enough to carry O but not impede BF
    - Tissue Oxygenation: decrease here → ^ RBC production
        - High altitudes: RBC ^^ bc lower amount of O transported to tissues
    - Hypoxia → ^^ erythropoietin production → RBC production
        - 90% of erythropoietin formed in kidneys (liver )
        - hypoxia → ^in transcription factor for the protein
    - Erythropoietin ^ proertyhroblast production + speeds the stages of development

  

![[Untitled 117.png]]

![[Untitled 118.png]]

- Maturation of RBC
    - Requires vitamin B12 + folic acid
        - Both needed for thymidine triphosphate for DNA
        - Lack → not enough RBC, large flimsy macrocyte RBC that break easily
    - B12: can fail to be absorbed in GI tract
        - Lacking intrinsic factor that protects vitamin from digestion from secretions + allows it to bind to membrane + be transported into blood
    - Folic acid: veggies, fruits, meats; absorption issues often coincide with ^

- Hemoglobin Formation
    - Chains: alpha, beta, gamma, delta
    - Hemoglobin A: 2 alpha, 2 beta
    - 4 chains = 4 iron atoms + 4 O mols.: binds with coordination bonds of Fe, carried as mol. O (2 O atoms)
    - Chain abnormalities affects binding + shape

![[Untitled 119.png]]

- Iron Metabolism
    
    ![[Untitled 120.png]]
    
    - Absorption in SI:
        - Apotransferrin binds w/ free Fe → transferrin
        - binds w/ receptors of epithelial cells to be absorbed + transfer to cap. via plasma transferring
        - Very slow, total amount regulated by changing rate
    - In the Cell:
        - Iron + apoferritin → ferritin or storage iron
        - Some is in insoluble _hemosiderin_ that collects in large clusters
    - When Fe needed
        - Fe from ferritin storage pool → transferrin in plasma to tissues
        - Binds to membranes of erythroblasts in marrow + Ingested → delivered to mitochondria to make heme
- RBC Life Span - 120 days
    - Cytoplasmic enzymes maintain membrane transport, keep iron in ferrous state, prevent oxidation of proteins etc.
    - These processes wear out + RBC become fragile
    - RBC rupture passing through tight spots: spleen red pulb
    - Hemoglobin phagocytized by macrophages: hemoglobin sent back to blood to marrow or to storage as ferritin
        - Porphyrin of hemoglobin also converted to bile pigment bilirubin

  

Anemias: hemoglobin deficiency, too few cells or too little hemoglobin in them

![[Untitled 121.png]]

- Types
    - Blood Loss: not enough Fe absorbed to replace hemoglobin
        - microcytic hypochromic anemia: small RBC w/ little hemoglobin
    - Aplastic: bone marrow does not fxn
    - Megoblastic: lack of B12, folic acid, or intrinsic factor needed for raw materials for more RBC
        - Megoblasts: large oddly shaped, fragile membranes
    - Hemolytic: hereditary
        - Spherocytosis: small spherical, easily ruptured
        - Sickle cell: hemoglobin S causes hemoglobin crystals to form
        - Erythroblastosis fetalis: Rh-positive fetus RBC attacked by antibodies from Rh-neg mother
            - Underdeveloped blast forms released in attempt to compensate
- Effects
    - Viscosity falls + hypoxia leads to vasodilation → more blood flow to heart → ^ cardiac output
    - Can compensate for hypoxia at rest but during exercise → acute cardiac failure can occur

  

Secondary Polycythemia : blood forming organs produce more RBC

- Types
    - Physiological polycythemia: high altitudes
    - Polycythemia Vera: RBC production in excess
        - ^ hematocrit, ^ blood vol. ^ viscosity
- Effects
    - ^ viscosity → reduced venous return to heart but balanced by ^ blood vol → increased venus return
    - Arterial pres. normal usually: regulation accounts for increased resistance
    - Blood slows in caps. + there’s more of it that’s deoxygenated → ruddy complexion w/ bluish tint

  

# Ch 34 Resistance of the Boyd to Infection: I. Leukocytes, Granulocytes, the Monocyte — Macrophage System, and Inflammation

Components of Immune System

- Leukocytes (WBCs) + tissue cells derived from them
- Destroys invaders via _phagocytosis_ and _antibody / sensitized lymphocyte_ formation

Transplants: new Blood type, taste, allergies

  

  

Leukocytes WBCs

- Types
    - neutrophils
    - eosinophils
    - basophils
    - monocytes: immature in circulation, activated to _tissue macrophage_ in tissue
        - Devours more + larger invaders, role in starting antibody production
    - lymphocytes
    - plasma cells
    - Platelets: pieces of megakaryocyte
- Granulocytes = neutrophils, eosinophils basophils

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Type|Formation|Lifespan|
|Granulocyte|bone marrow|4-8 hrs (blood), 4-5 days tissue|
|Monocyte|bone marrow|10-20 blood, months|
|Lymphocyte|lymph tissue|Back to lymph system after a few hours|
|Platelets|bone marrow|Cycled every 10 days|

  

Neutrophils + Macrophages Fight Infections

- WBCs circulate in blood → enter tissue via squeezing (diapedesis) → movement via ameboid motion → directed by …
- Chemotaxis: chemical substances that cause neutrophil + macrophage movement towards the source
    - Bacteria / virus toxins, byproducts of inflammation, complement complex, plasma clotting products
- Phagocytosis: neutrophils + macrophages (gets larger + more invaders)
    - Avoids normal cells: smooth, protein repelling coats, _opsonization_ process not applied (antibodies adhere to bacteria + enhance phagocytosis see below)
    - Target is engulfed into a _phagocytic vesicle (phagosome)_ + digested
        - Proteolytic enzymes from lysosomes + lipases in macrophages
        - Oxidizing agents from peroxisome kill bacteria with protection from ^

  

Monocyte-Macrophage Cell System (Reticuloendothelial Sys)

- Monocytes, mobile macrophages, fixed tissue macrophages, + specialized endothelial cells = phagocytotic system in various tissues
- Skin: local attached macrophages divide + attack
- Lymph Nodes: before reaching blood, lymph absorbs invasive particles
    - Nodes w/ macrophages all along mesh of sinuses
- Lungs: macrophages in alveolar walls trapping particles
- Liver: Kupffer cells line liver sinusoids + destroy bacteria from GI tract
- Spleen + Bone Marrow: deals w/ invaders that make it to general circulation
    - Macrophages trapped in meshwork of these tissues + trap particles
    - Spleen: similar to lymph nodes but w/ blood

  

Inflammation: substances released from injured tissues + the resulting changes

- Inflammation components:
    - Vasodilation
    - Permeability of caps. : lots of fluid in interstitial space
    - Often clotting: more fibrinogen + proteins leaking from caps.
    - Migration of granulocytes + monocytes to tissue
    - Swelling of tissue cells
- Walling off: tissue + lymphatics of target area blocked by fibrinogen clots
- Intensity of inflammation prop. to intensity of cell damage

  

Lines of Defense: Response of Neutrophils + Macrophages to Inflammation

- 1st: latent macrophages in tissues become mobile + enlarge for phagocytosis
- 2nd: neutrophils enter inflamed tissue from blood = extravasation
    - Cytokines cause increased expression of adhesion molecules (selectins, + ICAM-1) → neutrophils stick to cap + venule walls = margination
    - Intercellular links of endothelial cells loosen → openings into tissue spaces
    - Chemotaxis guides neutrophils
        
        ![[Untitled 122.png]]
        
    - Neutophilia occurs: more neutrophils in circulating blood from marrow stores

- 3rd: monocytes from blood enter area, slower build up due to smaller quantity circulating + in storage
- 4th: increased production of granulocytes + monocytes in marrow
    - Mediated by several factors, most importantly colony stimulating factors
    - Substances released by activated macrophage cells + inflamed tissue
- Pus: necrotic tissue from dead neutrophils / macrophages
    
    - Autolyzed over a couple days
    
      
    

![[Untitled 123.png]]

  

Eosinophils

- Produced to combat parasitic infections
- Attach to surface + release substances to kill them: hydrolytic enzymes, reactive forms of O, major basic protein
- Also present tissues of allergic reactions: mast + basophils release a chemotactic factor that draws them tin

  

Basophils

- Similar to mast cells: liberates heparin (prevent clotting), releases histamine
- Allergic Reactions: IgE has affinity for mast cells + basophils
    - Antigen + IgE antibody combo → mast / basophil releases substances that cause allergic manifestations

  

Leukopenia: marrow produces few WBCs

- Bacteria normally in symbiosis around exposed areas (mouth, GI, lungs etc.) attack body
- Can be caused by radiation, chemicals
- Recoverable w/ time + drugs to prevent infection while new marrow is formed + new WBCs

  

Leukemias: overproduction of WBCs in blood

- Lymphocytic or myelogenous depending on if it’s in lymphoid cells or myelogenous cells in marrow
- Produces undifferentiated cells that are non functional
- Effects: pain, fragile bones, infection, anemia, bleeding tendency
    - Uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells
    - Spreading to vascular areas, nodes, liver, spleen
    - Normal cells displaced by nonfunctional ones
    - Metabolic starvation of healthy cells

# Ch 35 Resistance of the Body to Infection: II. Immunity and Allergy

Thymus: has memory to every combinations

- Re-exposure increases reaction
- 2-3 weeks : adaptive expands, COVID patients die

  

Innate Immunity:

- Phagocytosis of invaders, destroyed invaders by stomach acid + digestive enzymes, skin resistance, substances in blood that destroy invaders (lysozyme, complement complex, natural killer lymphocytes etc)

  

Acquired (Adaptive Immunity): antibodies and/or activated lymphocytes to destroy specific invaders

- Two Types
    - Humoral: circulating antibodies produced y B-cell
    - Cell-mediated / T-cell: specific T lymphocytes are formed
- Recognizing the invader: antigens
    - Foreign substances have a chemical identifier → antigen (antibody generator)
    - Proteins or large polysaccharides: high MW 8000+ and epitopes - recurring molecular groups
- Lymphocytes
    - Lymphoid Tissue: intercepts invaders + prevents spread
        - Placement in GI tract wall, throat, lymph nodes for peripheral tissue, spleen/thymus/marrow for general circulation
    - T and B Lymphocytes
        - Production: differentiated from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells
        - Preprocessing
            
            ![[Untitled 124.png]]
            
            - T lymphocytes: thymus gland
                - T lymphocytes develop specificity for one antigen
                - Thymus phagocytizes cells that react w/ self-antigens
                - Preprocessing occurs shortly before birth + a few months after
            - B lymphocytes: mid-fetal life (liver), afterwards in marrow
                - Fxn of antibody secretion
                - Even more diversity than T lymphocytes
- Rxn w/ Antigens
    - Process: antigen contacts T + B cells → activated T cells form → B cells produce antibodies → antibodies + antibodies react against the origin of the antigen
    - Lymph stores B + T lymphocytes specific for millions of antigens
        - Each produces large numbers of clones that also secrete specific antibodies (B) or are sensitized to an antigen
        - Few thousand genes code for this variety: T / B stem cells contain gene segments
            - segments are mixed + combined to form whole genes during preprocessing
            - Millions of possible combos
    - Rxn w/ specific Antigen achieved via complementary receptors
        - B: antibody molecules on membrane
        - T: _surface receptor proteins_
    - Role of Macrophages: digests invaders + passes antigen products to lymphocytes
    - Role of T-helper cells in activating B-Cells
        - T-helper cells secrete lymphokines to activate B cells → enables large quantities of antibodies
- Antibodies
    - Formation via Plasma Cells:
        - Macrophages present antigens to B-cells + T-cells: T-cells form helper T cells and B- Cells…
        - Enlarge + become lymphoblasts → differentiate into…
            - Plasmablasts → cytoplasm + rough ER expands + cells divide → mature plasma cells → produce antibodies rapidly until death
                - Antibodies secreted to lymph + to blood
                - Short-lived plasma cells die after a few days
                - Long-lived: stay in marrow + lymphoid tissue + produce antibodies for years!
            - Memory cells: identical to original activated B-cell clone
                - Proliferates moderate + spread to lymphoid tissue
                - Dormant until antigen re-exposure → quicker + powerful response w/ more B-cell clones

- Structure of Antibodies
    - Gamma globulins called _immunoglobulins_
    - Light + heavy polypeptide chains, in pairs
    - Constant portion: defines properties like adherence, diffusivity etc.
    - Variable area has specific AA organization for binding specificity
        - Bound by hydrophobic, hydrogen, wan der Waals bonds / forces
- Classes: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE
    - IgG = 75%, IgE = allergies, IgM = 10 binding sites

![[Untitled 125.png]]

- Mechanisms of Action: direct attack + complement
    - Direct: antibodies bind 2 antigens + thus clump invaders together
        - Agglutination: clumping
        - Precipitation: antigen + antibody becomes insoluble
        - Neutralization: antibodies cover toxic sites
        - Lysis: rupture cell membrane
    - Complement System
        - Complement: 20 proteins normally inactive in blood + tissue spaces
        - Classical pathway: antigen-antibody binding → uncovers C1 binding site
            
            ![[Untitled 126.png]]
            
        - Results
            - Opsonization + phagocytosis: C3b
            - Lysis: membrane attack complex C5b6789
            - Agglutination: modifies surface of invaders
            - Neutralization viruses directly
            - Chemotaxis: C5a
            - Mast + basophil activation: C3a C4a, C5a
                - Release of histamine, heparin →^ blood flow), leakage of fluid + plasma
            - Other inflammatory effects: ^^ BF, cap. leakage, interstitial fluid proteins to coagulate → slow invader movement

- T-Cell Rxn to Antigens
    - Antigen exposure → T-cell clones formed + sent into lymph to circulate
        - Also T-cell memory cells formed
    - Recognizing antigens: must be bound to MHC proteins on _antigen-presenting cells_
        - Antigen presenting: macrophages, B cells, dendritic (primary)
        - MHC proteins encoded by _major histocompatibility complex_
            - MHC I present antigens to cytotoxic T cells
            - MHC II present to T-helper cells

![[Untitled 127.png]]

  

- T-Cell Types:
    - T-Helper: 75% of T cells, regulates via protein mediators - lymphokines
        - Growth + proliferation of cytotoxic / regulatory T-cells: Interleukin 2
        - B-cell response: interleukins 4-6
        - Macrophage system: accumulation (slowing once they reach chemotactic source), efficient phagocytosis
        - Positive feedback to activate more helpers
    - Cytotoxic / Killer : receptors bind them to antigens on invaders
        - Secrete hole-forming proteins - _perforins_
    - Regulatory: suppression of killer + helper cells

![[Untitled 128.png]]

- Immune Tolerance
    - Preprocessing: T cells in thymus + B cells in marrow
    - Failure of this mech. = autoimmune disease: body’s own tissues destroyed + self-antigens are released + picked up by activated T cells or antibodies
- Immunization via Injection: weakened invader that still has characteristic antigens
    - Dead organisms, toxins treated with chemicals to be nontoxic, live but attenuated organisms
- Passive Immunity: infuse with antibodies, T cells from blood of someone else immunized to an antigen
    - Lasts for a couple weeks (days if from animal)

  

Allergy and Hypersensitivity

- Delayed-Rxn: poison ivy
    - Second exposure activates helper + killer T cells
    - T-cells trigger cell-mediated rxn + release tissue damaging substances
- Atopic Allergies: genetic tendency for allergies
    - Large amounts of IgE that react with allergens
    - IgE attaches to mast + basophil cells
    - Allergen + IgE antibodies + mast/basophil ⇒ bursting of mast / basophil
    - Release of histamine, protease, etc…
- Effects
    - Anaphylaxis: widespread rxn in vascular sys + tissues
        - Histamine released causing vasodilation + ^ cap. permeability
            - Countered w/ epinephrine
        - Slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis: leukotrienes that cause smooth muscle spasm of bronchioles (asthma attack)
    - Urticaria: localized rxn of vasodilation + ^ cap. permeability ⇒ hives
    - Hay fever: rxn in the nose
        - Swelling causing fluid leakage, countered with antihistamine
    - Asthma: rxn in bronchioles of lungs, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis
        - Not as effectively treated w/ antihistamines

# Ch 36 Blood Types; Transfusion; and Tissue and Organ Transplantation

Immune Rxn of Blood

- 30 common antiens, most weak
- O-A-B and Rh cause rxns

  

O-A-B Blood Types

- Agglutinogens: A + B antigens on the surfaces of RBCs
    - Determined from 3 alleles: I^A, I^B, I^O
    - O is fxnless → no O agglutinogen (reccessive)
- Agglutinins: antibodies developed in response to agglutinogens, anti-A and anti-B
    - Lack of A agglutinogen → antibody anti-A agglutinin forms in blood
    - Mostly IgM + IgG immunoglobin mols
    - Formed after birth
- Transfusion Rxns: RBCs agglutinate when agglutinins attach themselves to agglutinogens on RBCs
    - Bursting of RBCs releases hemoglobin → hemolysis: physical stress induced or by WBC phagocytosis
    - Immediate hemolysis: antibodies activate complement system to form membrane attack complex
- Blood typing: Type A blood has agglutinogens - can’t be with anti-A agglutinins (B, AB)

  

Rh Blood Types: requires initial exposre

- Rh factor: C,D,E,c,d,e
    - People have one of each letter pairing
- Rh +: presence of type D, more antigenic
- anti-Rh agglutinins develop in 2-4 months
- Immune response after transfusion: 2-4 weeks, repeated exposure increases the response
- Erythroblastosis Fetalis: Rh - mother, Rh + father
    - Baby has Rh + antigen from father → mother develops anti-Rh agglutinins (antibodies) → agglutinins cause agglutination in baby’s RBC
    - Incidence increases with subsequent births
    - Effects: agglutination → hemolysis → macrophages turn hemoglobin to bilirubin
        - Jaundiced, anemic, rapid RBC production → early forms in circulation
        - Nerve damage due to bilirubin in destroying nerve cells → _kernicterus_
    - Treatment: replace baby blood w/ Rh - until mother’s anti-Rh agglutinins are destroyed
    - Treat mother with _Rh immunoglobulin globin_ , anti-D antibody
        - inhibits antigen-induced B cell antibody production

  

Transfusion Rxn from Mismatched Blood Types

- RBCs of donor blood are agglutinated
- Donor blood’s agglutinins are reduced but recipient has normal levels of agglutinins to react with foreign donor cells
- Acute kidney failure:
    - Vasoconstriction: rxn to toxic substances in blood
    - Circulatory shock: loss of RBs circulating + toxic substances → arterial blood pres. drops + RBF + urine output decrease
    - Renal tubular blockage: excess hemoglobin precipitates + blocks tubules

  

Tissue / Organ Transplantation

- RBC antigens are present in other tissue cells
- Graft types
    - auto (Same animal), iso (identical twin), allo (same species), xeno (different animal species)
- Overcoming Rxns
    - Tissue Typing: matching _human leukocyte antigens_ HLAs
    - Immune Sys Suppression: T-cells specifically
        - Reduce cytokines, inhibit formation, inhibit T-helpers specifically

  

  

# Ch 37 Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation

Hemostasis = stoppage of blood loss: vascular construction, platelet plug, blood clot, fibrous tissue

- Vascular Constriction: proportional to degree of damage
    - Local myogenic spasm
    - Autacoid factors from tissue, vascular endothelium, platelets (thromboxane A_2)
    - Nervous reflexed: pain + sensory impulses
- Platelet Plug: fills small holes
    - Platelets: 1-4 um disks, fragments of megakaryocytes from bone marrow
        - Contains: actin / myosin mols, ER + Golgi structures, mitochondira to form ATP/ADP, enzyme systems that form hormones
        - Fibrin-stabilizing factor, growth factor for vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts
        - Glycoprotein coating: adherence to injured vessel wall
        - Half life 8-12 days
    - Plug Formation
        
        ![[Untitled 129.png]]
        
        - Platelets triggered by damaged vascular → swell, release active factors, become sticky
        - Adheres to collagen via _von Willebrand factor_
        - Activates more nearby platelets
        - Fibrin threads form to solidify plug

- Blood Coagulation
    - Activation of clotting process via substances from damaged vessel wall, platelets, + blood proteins adhering to vascular wall
    - Activates in 15-20s or 1-2 minutes, clot filled 3-6, retraction 20-60
    - Clot either is invaded by fibroblasts forming connective tissue OR dissolved if in unneeded location

![[Untitled 130.png]]

Mechanism of Blood Coagulation

- Summary
    - Balance of procoagulants + anticoagulants determines clotting
    - Process
        - Damage → prothrombin activator formed
        - Prothrombin activator converts prothrombin to thrombin
        - Thrombin converts fibrinogen → fibrin fibers

![[Untitled 131.png]]

- Prothrombin → Thrombin
    - Prothrombin activator formed → w/ enough Ca converts prothrombin to thrombin → 10-15s
        - Bottleneck is activator formation
        - Prothrombin attaches to receptors on platelets on damaged tissue
    - Prothrombin: globulin MW 68700, splits into thrombin
        - Formed in liver, Vitamin K needed
- Fibrinogen → Fibrin: Clot Formation
    - 340,000 MW protein formed in liver
    - Does not reach interstitial fluid (large size) until cap. permeability is ^
    - Thrombin Action
        - Removes 4 low MW peptides from fibrinogen → fibrin monomers
        - Weak chains form
        - Thrombin activates _fibrin stabilizing factor_ from platelets → covalent bonds + cross linking
    - Blood clot = mesh of fibrin fibers trapping RBC, platelets, plasma + adhering to vessels
    - Clot Retraction
        - Retracts + expresses fluid _serum_: plasma w/o fibrinogen + clotting factors
        - Platelets needed: contracts w/ stored Ca after activation by thrombin
- Positive Feedback
    - Thrombin activates other blood-clotting factors such as prothrombin in addition to fibrinogen
    - Positive feedback past a critical threshold of thrombin
- Initiation of Coagulation: Formation of prothrombin activator
    - Formation of prothrombin activator due to… damage to vascular wall, trauma to blood, blood contact to damaged tissue

- Pathways: involves plasma protein _blood clotting factors_
    - Extrinsic: trauma to vascular wall + tissues
        - Tissues release _tissue factor_
        - TF activates factor VII + Ca → Xa
        - Combines w/ V + tissue phospholipids → prothrombin activator
            - X splits prothrombin
            - V accelerates
    - Intrinsic Pathway: blood
        - Trauma activates factor XII and release of platelet factor 3
            - Factor XII/platelets come into contact w/ collagen or wettable surface like glass
        - XI activated in presences of HMW kininogen + sped up by prekallikrien
        - IX activated by XI
        - Factor X activated via IX, VIIIa, III, platelet products
        - Factor X forms prothrombin activator
    - Ca needed

![[Untitled 132.png]]

![[Untitled 133.png]]

- Both occur together
    - Tissue factor triggers extrinsic, XII + platelet contact w/ collagen triggers intrinsic
    - Extrinsic is explosive → 15s (vs 1-6 mins for intrinsic)
- Prevention of Clotting Normally
    - Vascular Features: smooth endothelial surface, glycocalyx repelling clotting factors + platelets, thrombomodulin binding thrombin
        - Also produces _prostacyclin_ + _nitric oxide_ to inhibit platelet aggregation + blood clot initiation
        - Damage stops these mechanisms
    - Anticoagulants: remove thrombin from blood
        - Fibrin fibers: absorbs 85-90%
        - antithrombin III / antithrombin heparin cofactor: binds the remaining thrombin
            - Also activates anticoagulant _protein C_
        - Heparin: greatly ^ effectiveness of antithrombin III
            - Small amounts from basophilic _mast cells_
- Plasmin Causes Blood Clot Lysis
    - Activated from plasminogen: inactive in clot until release _tissue plasminogen activator_ a few days later form injured tissues
    - _plasmin_ : digests fibrin fibers + coagulants
    - Frees up many small vessels blocked by clots

  

Conditions of Excessive Bleeding: deficiencies in factors

- Often due to liver disease where most clotting factors are formed
- Vitamin K: adds carboxyl group to glutamic acid resides on _prothrombin, VII, IX, X, and protein C_
    - Synthesize in intestinal tract
    - Poor fat absorption in GI can lead to deficiency: ex - liver failing to secrete bile
- Hemophilia
    - Hemophilia A: lack of small component of factor VIII (large one = von Willebrand disease)
    - Hemophilia B: factor IX
    - Usually inherited mostly males: recessive female X chromosome
    - Treated via factor injections: expensive w/ short halflives
- Thrombocytopenia : lack of platelets
    - Damage in small vessels
    - Symptoms: petechiae (red/purple blotches), failure of clots to retract (dependent on factors from platelets)
    - Causes: damage to marrow, antibodies destroying platelets, pooling in spleen, consumption in thrombi, dilution due to blood loss
    - Most cases have no known cause triggering antibodies to destroy platelets
    - Treat w/ whole blood transfusions or splenectomy (normally removes lots of platelets)

  

Thromboembolic Conditions

- Thrombi and emboli: thrombus = abnormal clot, free flowing = emboli
    - Forming in arteries / left side of heart → pug arteries leading to organs
    - Forming in venous system / right side → pulmonary arterial embolism
    - Caused by rough endothelial surface or slow flowing blood
    - Treatment via injection of synthetic _tissue plasminogen activator -_ dissolves clots via plasmin
- Can occur in bed bound patients, propping news up with pillows: massive pulmonary embolism if blocking pulmonary arteries
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation: clotting activated in widespread circulation
    - Due to lots of damaged / dying tissue releasing lots of tissue factor
    - Small but many clots → less O / nutrients to tissues → septic shock

  

Anticoagulants for Clinical Use

- Heparin: purified form animal tissues
    - Increase in clotting time from 6 to 30 minutes, near instant effect
- Coumarins (warfarin): reduce levels of factors VII, IX, X, + active prothrombin
    - Prevent formation of active vitamin K
    - 0.5-1 day to take effect: only blocking production
- Outside the body
    - Siliconized containers: prevent platelet + factor XII activation
    - Heparin: heart-lung machines
    - Decrease Ca concentration : oxalate compound
    - Deionize blood Ca: citrate ion, non toxic

  

Blood Coagulation Tests

- Bleed time: 1-6 mins
- Clotting time: glass tube tipped back and forth 6-10 minutes
- Prothrombin Time: indicates [prothrombin]
    - Blood is oxalated + then Ca ions + tissue factor added → measure coagulation time, normal 12 seconds
    - Standardized with _international normalized ratio_: ISI = sensitivity index of tissue factor used
        
        ![[Untitled 134.png]]
        
        - Normally 0.9-1.3: higher = bleeding risk, lower = clotting risk
- Other tests possible: oxalated blood → add Ca + factors + the one being tested

  

# Ch 38 Pulmonary Ventilation

  

_Voluntary control of sneezing fGI_

  

Respiration: provide O, remove CO2

- Pulmonary ventilation : flow of air betwixt atmosphere + alveoli - > O + CO2 diffusion betwixt alveoli + blood → transport of O/CO2 to tissue → regulation of ventilation

  

Mechanics of Pulmonary Ventilation

- Muscles
    - Expansion / contraction via diaphragm OR ribs
    - Diaphragm: pulls lungs down + elastic recoil expels air
        - Additional force from abdominal muscles
    - Rib cage: elevation ^ diameter (ribs slanted downward)
        - External intercostals contract along with other muscles
        - Internal intercostals + abdominal recti pull down

![[Untitled 135.png]]

- Pressures Causing Air Movement : lungs “float” in pleural fluid of thoracic cavity
    - Pleural Pres.: slightly negative pres. -5 cm H20 keeps lungs suctioned in place
        - Inspiration: -7.5
    - Alveolar Pres.: when open to air pres = 0, slightly negative during inspiration
    - Transpulmonary Pres. - dif. betwixt pleural + aveoli pres.

- Compliance : expansion / pressure increase, normally 200 ml air / cm H20 transpul. pres.
    - Defined by
        - Elastic forces of lung tissue: elastin + collagen fibers
            - Kinked + contracted when lung is deflated, stretched during expansion
        - Elastic forces of surface tension of fluid
            - Interface betwixt alveolar fluid + air
    - Tissue elastic = 1/3, surface tension = 2/3

![[Untitled 136.png]]

- Surfactant + Surface Tension
    - Water mols attracted to one another on alveoli surface → force air out through bronchi → alveoli try to collapse = surface tension elastic force
    - Surfactant: reduces surface tension of water
        - Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, surfactant apoproteins + Ca dissolve unevenly on surface of alveoli
        - Reduces effort to expands lungs
    - Pressure in occluded alveoli = 2 x ST / radii : premature infants w/ small alveoli have doubled pressures + lungs tend to collapse
- Compliance of Thorax + Lungs: half of lungs alone 110 ml / cm H20
- Work of breathing: normally only inspiration, expiration is elastic recoil
    - overcome elastic forces _compliance work / elastic work_, viscosity of structures _tissue resistance work_, airway resistance
    - Energy requirement increases greatly during exercise: limiting factor = muscle energy for respiration alone

  

Pulmonary Volumes and Capacities

- Spirometry: volume measurements of air in + out of lungs

![[Untitled 137.png]]

![[Untitled 138.png]]

  

- Pulmonary Volumes: varies with age, height, fitness

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tidal Vol|Normal breathing|
|Inspiratory Reserve|Max inspiration (after tidal)|
|Expiratory Reserve|Max expiration (after tidal)|
|Residual|Air in lungs post max expiration|

- Pulmonary Capacities:
    - Inspiratory Cap = tidal + inspiratory reserve: max level you can breathe in
    - Functional residual cap = expiratory reserve + residual : amount of air in lungs after normal expiration
    - Vital Cap = inspiratory reserve + tidal + expiratory reserve : max you can expel after max fill
    - Total Lung Cap: vital cap + residual vol : max vol you can expand lungs to
- Functional residual cap.: volume in lungs after normal expiration, marker of fxn
    - Helium dilution measurement: expire normally, breathe in helium of known []. result is diluted (V = vol)
        
        ![[Untitled 139.png]]
        
    - RV = FRC - ERV, TLC =FRC + Inspiratory cap.
- Minute respiratory vol = amount of new air into respiratory passages each min : tidal vol x respiratory rate per min (500 ml x 12 breath/min)

  

Alveolar Ventilation

- Pulmonary ventilation renews air in gas exchange areas near pulmonary blood
    - Rate of air reaching alveoli, alveolar sacs, ducts + respiratory bronchioles = alveolar ventilation

- Dead Space: air filling respiratory passages, no gas exchange
    - Measure by inhaling 100 O2
    - Record output: all O2 = dead space
    - Nitrogen returns once alveolar air mixes w/ dead space
    - [N] reaches that of alveoli []
    - Area of gray = dead space vol
    - Anatomic dead space ^; addition of non fxnal alveoli = physiological dead space, much ^^

![[Untitled 140.png]]

- Rate of Alveolar Ventilation
    
    - Determines [O] and [CO2] in alveoli
    
    ![[Untitled 141.png]]
    

  

- Respiratory Passageways
    - Trachea, bronchi, bronchioles
    - Kept open for easy air passage: cartilage rings (trachea), cartilage plates (bronchi), transpulmonary pres in bronchioles
    - Smooth muscle walls
    - Resistance to air flow: greatest in larger bronchioles + bronchi, more air needed to pass
        - Disease can cause issue occluding smaller bronchioles: contraction, mucus

![[Untitled 142.png]]

- Control
    - Few sympathetic nerve fibers
        - Release of norepinephrine + epinephrine from adrenal gland → dilation
    - Parasympathetic nerves secrete acetylcholine → constriction
        - Can also activate from within lungs: irritation
        - Histamine + slow reactive substance of anaphylaxis : from mast cells during allergic rxns
- Mucus Lining: from goblet cells, moved via cilia power strokes toward pharynx to be swallowed / coughed
- Cough: irritants cause afferent nerve pulses to medulla of brain
    - Rapid inspiration of 2.5L
    - Air trapped in lungs
    - Abdominal muscles contract to raise lung pressure
    - Vocal cords + epiglottis open widely so air explodes out through bronchial + tracheal slits
- Sneeze: similar but in nasal passageways , uvula depressed
- Respiratory Fxn of Nose: warm, humidify, partially filter
    - Filter:
        - turbulent precipitation: air hits vanes + changes direction, heavier particles continue + strike surfaces to be trapped by mucus
    - < 6 um particles continue
        - 1-5 um settle in bronchioles via gravitational precipitation
        - Some removed by alveolar macrophages
- Vocalization
    - Speech: nervous control in cerebral cortex, respiratory control centers, articulation + resonance structures of mouth + nasal cavities
    - Phonation: larynx, vibrating vocal folds
        - Cords move together during speech to cause vibration
        - Varies w/ stretch, relative tightness, mass of edges
        - Ligaments attach to cartilages + muscles rotate + pull cartilage
    - Articulation + Resonance:
        - Articulation: lips, tongue, soft palate
        - Resonance: mouth, noise, nasal sinuses, pharynx, chest cavity

# Ch 39 Pulmonary Circulation, Pulmonary Edema, and Pleural Fluid

Lung Circulations

- High pres. low flow: arterial blood to trachea, bronchial tree, outer coats of pulmonary arteries + veins
    - Bronchial arteries supply arterial blood
- Low pres. high flow: supplies venous blood from body to alveolar cap. for O / CO2 exchange
    - Pulmonary artery receives blood from right ventricle + carries it to alveolar caps.
    - Pulmonary veins returns blood to left atrium → left ventricle

  

Anatomy of Pulmonary Circulatory System

- Pulmonary Vessels
    - Pulmonary artery: splits to left + right lungs
        - Less thick walls, thin + distensible = large compliance: accommodates stroke vol. from right ventricle
- Bronchial Vessels
    - Oxygenated blood to supporting lung tissue via bronchial arteries
    - Empties to pulmonary vein + left atrium
- Lymphatics: handles particle + plasma protein leakage → sent to right thoracic lymph duct

  

Pressures in Pulmonary System

- Right ventricle falls faster than pulmonary artery after systole (contraction)
- Systolic pul. arterial pres. = ~25 mmHg, diastolic 8 mm Hg, mean 15
- Low cap. pres. 7 mm Hg
- Left Atrial + Pulm. Venous Pres.: ~2 mm Hg recumbent
    - Pulmonary Wedge Pres.: catheter via peripheral vein to righ tside of heart + wedge in small branch of pulmonary artery
    - 2-3 higher than left atrial pres.

![[Untitled 143.png]]

  

Blood Vol of Lungs

- 450 mL, 9%: can be half or double this
- High pressure = expulsion of blood to systemic circulation
- Blood build up in due to mitral valve issues or left side heart failure: ^ in blood vol + pressures

  

Blood Flow through Lungs + its Distribution

- BF in lungs = cardiac output: same factors control it
- Distribution matters for adequate aeration:
    - Hypoxia → _constriction of_ nearby vessels (opposite of systemic vessels)
    - Blood flow goes to better aerated alveoli
- Possible Mechanism
    - Release or ^ sensitivity to vasoconstrictor substances
    - Decrease release of vasodilator
    - Inhibit O sensitive K channels → depolarization + Ca channel activation

![[Untitled 144.png]]

  

Effect of Hydrostatic Pres. Gradients in Lungs on Regional Pulmonary Blood Flow

- Hydrostatic Pres Effect: pres. in upper lung = 15 < pulmonary artery at heart level, lower lungs is 8 >

- 3 regions of blood flow: balance of alveolar air pres. on outside of caps. + cap. blood pres. inside
    - Zone 1 - no blood flow: cap. pres. never higher than alveolar air pres.
    - Zone 2 - intermittent flow: peaks of pul. arterial pres. in caps. during systole
    - Zone 3 - continuous flow: alvelor cap. pres. always > alveolar air pres.
- Normal Lung Zones: 2 + 3
    - Apical part: intermittent, flow during systole (25 at heart - 15 hydrostatic = 10 > 0 alveolar air pres.)
    - lower part: continuous flow
    - Lying down → lungs above heart level, all zone 3

![[Untitled 145.png]]

- Abnormal Conditions: Zone 1: pulmonary systolic arterial pres. is too low OR alveo. pres. too high
- Exercise: increase blood flow in all parts, pulmonary vascular pres. rises → Zone 3 flow
    - Accommodated by ^ # of open caps, distending + ^ flow rate, ^ pulmonary arterial pres.
    - Does not need to increase pul. arterial pres.: conserve energy for RHS of heart
- Left side heart failure
    - Blood dams up + left atrial pres. rises from 1-5to 40-50
    - Past 7-8, further ^ → ^ load on RHS of heart + cap. pres. → pulmonary edema may develop

  

Pulmonary Cap. Dynamics

- Alveolar walls lined w/ any caps. → cap. blood flows as a “sheet of flow”
- Stats: estimated 7 mmHg, blood passes in 0.8 seconds (as low as 0.3)

- Fluid Exchange dynamics: similar to peripheral caps. but differences…
    
    - Much lower cap. pres. 7 vs 17
    - Interstitial fluid pres. is a bit more negative
    - Colloid osmotic pres. = 14, double that of peripheral
    - Alveolar walls are thin + epithelium is weak: rupture due to any + pres. in interstitial space > 0 mm Hg
    
      
    

![[Untitled 146.png]]

- Total outward force = 29, total inward = 28
    - +1 mmHg: slight flow of fluid out of cap. into interstitial spaces
    - Neg. pres. from lymphs to suck fluid
- Pulmonary Edema
    - Mech: ^ fluid filtration from caps, impeded lymphatics, pulmonary interstitial fluid pres. to rise to positive range
    - Causes:
        - Left sided heart failure / mitral valve disease: ^ in pul. venous pres. + pul. cap. pres.
        - Damage to cap. membranes
    - Safety Factor: experimentally 21 mmHg
        - In chronic ^ cap. pres. can increase x10: lymph vessels exapnd
    - Lethal within 20-30 minutes to hours

  

Fluid in Pleural Cavity

- Pleural membrane: porous to interstitial fluid w/ tissue proteins → mucus behavior
- Excess pumped to lymphatics
- Negative pres. outside lungs to keep expansion: pumping of fluid to lymphatics
    - Min 4, actual 7
- Pleural effusion / edema of pleural cavity:
    - Same causes leading to fluid build up
    - Blocked lymphs, increase membrane permeability, cardiac failure (high pres.), reduced plasma colloid osmotic pres.
