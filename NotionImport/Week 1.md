Paw2Paw: Ariel + Mirel

- Talk to 2, choose one
- 2 facts about each person
- 2 weeks to find a Gamma mom rip

Hi, this is Eileen Petros! I am an associate member at CWRU’s associate SLG chapter and we’ve been paired up for a Paw 2 Paw meeting. My schedule is pretty hectic but if you could let me know some potential times for a half hour zoom or phone call sometime this week I can see what works. I’d also be fine to connect over text if that’s more convenient or we can’t make the scheduling work out.

Looking forward to talking more! :)
