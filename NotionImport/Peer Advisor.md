> [!info] Measuring distance between objects in an image with OpenCV - PyImageSearch  
> We have now reached the final installment in our three part series on measuring the size of objects in an image and computing the distance between objects. Two weeks ago, we started this round of tutorials by learning how to (correctly) order coordinates in a clockwise manner using Python and OpenCV.
