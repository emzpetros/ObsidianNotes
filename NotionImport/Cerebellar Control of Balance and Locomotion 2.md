Clinical features: impaired balance + gait

Anantomy

- Functional zones
- "Thus, the medial cerebellar zone can integrate spinal and vestibular inputs  
    and influence important motor pathways for walking (i.e., vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts)”
- “the intermediate zone can integrate spinal and cortical inputs and influence walking through projections to motor cortical areas.”
- “Thus, the lateral cerebellum may influence walking via cortical interactions and may be most important for voluntary modifications to the locomotor cycle"

Vestibular + reticular nuclei:

- firing rates associated with gait cycle, lack of modulation in vestibular w/o cerebellum

Intermediate cerebellar region: over-ground less imapired than treadmill

Lateral: active for novel walking conditions, precise limb placement, when strong visual dependence is needed

- Visual information involved —> VR perturbations????

  

In summary, medial cerebellar regions play a primary role in regulating extensor tone, sustaining upright stance and dynamic balance control, and modulating the rhythmic flexor and extensor muscle activity that makes up the locomotor pattern. In contrast, the intermediate cerebellar regions play a fairly minimal role in controlling stance and posture. Instead, these regions appear more important for directing limb placement and regulating agonist-antagonist muscle pairs to control the relative timing, amplitude, and trajectory of limb movements, especially in circumstances in which more precision is required. The lateral cerebellum is less important for the control of balance and uninterrupted level walking. However, lateral cerebellar regions do seem to play a significant role in making adjustments to the normal locomotor pattern in novel contexts or when strong visual guidance is required.”

  

# Human Studies

Difficulties in isolating cerebellum damage only + further isolating specific regions

Cerebellar damage…

- Increased standing postural sway
- Hypermetric postural responses to surface displacements + impaired ability to learn responses to predictable pertur. during quiet standing

Humans may have more dependence on lateral portion due to bipedal vs quad walking

Level walking impairments show up due to balance deficits vs visual guidance issues

Increase joint decomposition

# Motor Learning

Important for trial+ error adaptation

# Future Research

Cerebellum contributes…

- “modulations of timing, rate, force of muscle
- Upright posture
- Adaptability
