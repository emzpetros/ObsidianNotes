Literature Type: Review Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: Assess methods of scoring stroop
Summary: |-
  No current scoring method is fully sufficient, need to consider speed + accuracy 
  Assess in all conditions: word reading (W), color naming (C), named color-word (CW)
Methods: |-
  All studies with healthy adults 
  No separation of age, medium of test

  32 articles
Theory: |-
  Assess ability to inhibit cog interference 
  Og experiment three tables: just read black and white text of colors, text of colors inked correctly, text of colors inked incorrectly
  - Inhibit automated reading in favor of less automated naming color

  Stroop assesses executive processes not just attention or cognitive processes generally : worse performance of Parkinson’s patients with intact attention abilities 
Key Results: |-
  https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00557/full#B19 scoring method:
  - Correct items in 45s
  - Compute predicted score Pcw = (WxC)/(W +C)
  - Interference score IG = CS - Pcw
  - Neg IG = ability to inhibit interference, lower scores = harder to inhibit

  Victoria Stroop Test: name colors of dots, name colors of common words, name color of color words
  - https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00557/full#B50 time and # of errors (corrected, non corrected, total)
  - I1 = word / dot for time
  - I2 = interference / dot for time
  - https://www.neuropsychologysa.co.za/test/victoria-stroop-test-vst/ time to name color in interference - time for dot task

  Other: completion time and # errors

  SUBJ PERFORMANCE
  Some used time needed to read all stimuli or a fixed number
  OR # correct answers in fixed time


  Recomendations:
  Calc accuracy + speed for all conditions - correct responses in fixed time
  Relate performance in interference condition to base reading abilities - CW - W - C
Conclusions: |-
  Need to compute time and accuracy: possible sol = correct answers in fixed time
  Error rate not speed = index of inhibitory control
  - Just error rate runs risk of including other conflicting factors, neurological disease populations with slower processing across the board
  - Can account for it with the W and C score being taken from the CW score


  Some combine the metrics but not computed independently…
Future work suggested: "Something to look into is the effect of reading ability, data suggests it doesn’t affect susceptibility to stroop interference "
