Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: Are different adaptation + task prioritization strats used for self-paced vs fixed dual task?
Summary: |-
  More local instability during self-paced
  More interference on stride time variation, local dynamic stabiltiy + Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test with self-paced

  Self-paced treadmill walking may be harder than fixed-speed and could be more suitable for dual-tasking
Methods: |-
  4 cognitive tasks + walk only: paced auditory serial addition test, paced auditory clock task, visual (1 second interval) + auditory stroop high (360 Hz) or a low pitch (180 Hz) every 1.25 s
  All 4 also done standing
Theory: |-
  Treadmills suitable for dual-tasking (easy measurement) but fixed-speed may reduce cognitive load
  Gait pattern with self-paced treadmills found to be similar
  May be some additional load to control the pacing
Outcome Measures: Dynamic margins of stability, step spatiotemporal measures, kinematic variability, local dynamic stability
Key Results: |-
  Only PASAT showed worse performance with self-paced

  The task matters, only PASAT was complex enough to effect gait + cognitive performance
Conclusions: |-
  Task prioritization changed with self-paced, interference increased
  Adaptation strats for gait remained similar 
Future work suggested: |-
  Patient populations other than healthy young adults

  Tasks had different time pressure, may be useful to set it relative to subj performance
Critiques: |-
  SD has a SD and mean has a SD - statistical aggregation of data is hard to understand 

  Use VR for a more complex dual task?
