Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): Dual Task
Objective of study: |-
  Evaluate dual-task gait testing in older adults, trans tibial
  Prevent interference from those who have learned to use prosthesis 
Summary: |-
  Recent prothesis users experience interference when dual tasking, reduced performance in gait and cognitive task
  Not applicable to seasoned prosthesis users
Materials: "GAITRite System: instrumented treadmill"
Methods: |-
  Self selected pace
  Count backwards by 3s from number 100-150

  Walking alone measured
  Cognitive task alone assessed via response rate

  Cognition assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
Theory: |-
  Foundation of cognitive motor interference
  Amputees particularly struggle
Outcome Measures: |-
  Pace, stride length, rhythm, cadence, variability in stride length + time; gait symmetry
  Means + SD or freqs + percentages
Key Results: |-
  Dual-tasking worsened velocity, cadence, stride time; step length, stance time, and single limbs support time symmetry affected

  Accuracy the same but rate of responses decreased 
Conclusions: Those learning to walk with prosthesis do experience interference in even “low challenge” walking
Future work suggested: How does cognitive motor interference relate to eventual fall risk
Critiques: |-
  Only applied to recent prosthesis users
  Did a good job recording single task performance

Do they cut them off if incorrect

Single support symmetry: not explicitly noted which leg was single support symmetry

Subjs using mobility aid instruments

  

Is the cognitive load an issue?

- Which cognitive burden affected their walking? fear of falls?

Able bodied same age range, how would it affect?

  

overground walking is not that complex of a task; why would we expect interference

- Obstacle course?
- TUG + cognitive task?
    - timed up and go test
- Block in way
- Hold a tray with an empty cup: pay more attention to sensation from the foot, coordination
- Walking with a cup and try not to spill water
    - Know how body is moving to compensate for water movement

  

What if no change? What does that mean for SNP?

- SNP doesn’t interfere
- Say perturbation exp has no difference: cognitive task to amplify if no difference at first

  

Stim and perturbation occur at same time:

- Give subject a distraction

  

Design treadmill + overground experiments

- GaitRITE: not as good for research vs clinical
- Use vicon long walkway
- Just walk overground and see what happens
    - Make it more complex after with tray

  

Start w/ Treadmill V stroop

- accuracy + responses #
- Start with able bodied
