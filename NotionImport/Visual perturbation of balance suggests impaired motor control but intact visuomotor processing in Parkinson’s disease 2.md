Literature Type: Paper
Relevant project(s): TBD
Objective of study: |-
  Investigate PD patient response to visual perturbation of balance in an effort to detect the disease earlier before visible motor impairments occur

  Do PD patients have impaired perception or execution of movement 
Materials: |-
  Used in previous studies [45]

  HTC Vive
  Wii Balance Board
  Microsoft Kinect v2: trakced 25 body joints
  harnessed in

  3D enviornmnet pyopenvr framework in OpenGL; 3D tunnel of black spheres
Methods: |-
  Include healthy adults to detect effects of aging

  Tunnel oscillation at 3 freqs + stationary in anterior-posterior direction

  Task to count color flips of focus point dot to keep peripheral vision stable
Theory: |-
  Postural stability takes input from visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs

  Moving room paradigm: initiated with sinusoidal oscillations of surroundings 
  Induces visually evoked postural responses (VEPR)

  Phase locking: from EEG, evaluates phase consistency of a signal over time and across trials 
  - Used to observe a shift in coordination startegy as a fxn of stimulus freq in healthy adults
  - freq power analysis + sway mag have high intersubj variability 
Outcome Measures: |-
  Center of pressure, center of mass, sway amplitudes, phase-locking analysis (consistency betwixt stimulus phase and bodily response over time and across trials)
  Mean sway amplitude 
Key Results: |+
  PD had higher sway amplitudes at all oscillations
  - AP direction, COM and COP, 
  - Ankle based strat: large amplitude around head 
  Tunnel motion only affected CT and YG

  Age matched controls: tunnel motion had an effect on overall sway of COP in AP direction 

  PD had more body sway: more at head, less at feet
  Like COP/COM tunnel movement had no effect on sway mag or distribution 

  PLV: same peak morphology, no significant dif in peak heat

  Body segment PLV: similar distributions until 
  - 1.2 Hz highest freq , more PL at hips; no difference betwixt PD + CT

Conclusions: |-
  PD had higher sway amplitudes at all oscillations
  - AP direction, COM and COP, 
  - Ankle based strat: large amplitude around head 
  Tunnel motion only affected CT and YG

  PL: consistent COP and COM w/ stim freq —> response to visual stimuli intact 
  - During visual perturbation, all subjs maintained mag of sway from when tunnel was motionless

  PD seem to have impaired motor control but visuomotor processing intact
  - Issue may be in vestibular or proprioceptive areas
  Or issues betwixt cerebellar + basal ganglia

  Reduced flexibility to adapt to perturbations seems to be effect of disease

  Different strats used to compensate: only detectable by body segment analysis 
  - may be due to rigidity in PD
Future work suggested: |-
  Investigate PL analysis at higher frequencies, confirm recruitment of feet + ankle muscles at higher freq with EMG
  test w/ smaller increments of freq

  See if compensation exists with later stage PD

  Test w/ patients not under dopaminergic medication: improves responses to sensorimotor system

  Small number, variety in disease progression + L-dopa
  Relatively small # of freq conditions + trials to avoid fatigue in subjs

  Apply setup to other populations to examine impaired balance + postural control 
Critiques: PLV need better title labeling to quickly distinguish COP vs COM without reading the nearly same captions
