Objective of study: Does sensory noise via electrical stim improve balance control in rxn to virtual perturbations in VR?  Is lower trunk or leg stimulation more effective?
Summary: Sensory noise during stim applied to trunk is effective in improving balance control
Materials: |-
  Valve Index
  force plate
  Unity
Methods: |-
  n = 18
  No glasses worn
  Eyes open + closed,
  Anteroposterior + mediolateral visual perturbations
  No stim, leg stim, trunk stim 
Theory: "Stochastic resonance  "
Outcome Measures: Ellipse area of sway, length of sway path, frequency
Key Results: Perturbation = increase in all measures for AP case, trunk stim more effective
Conclusions: Subsensory stim improved postural control in response to AP perturbations with trunk stim being more effective
Future work suggested: |-
  adaptation effect?
  Effect of trunk + leg stim together?
Critiques: |-
  n = low
  healthy adults
  Use for developing experiments

### **Abstract**

  

### **Overview/key points**

  

### **Methodology/Theory**

Stochastic resonance: presence of a certain level of noise allows sub-threshold stimuli to activate neuron membrane potentials â€”> sensitivity of mechanoreceptors increased!

### **Materials/Fabrication Methods**

Virtual walkway set to same width as force plate

Body not rendered

### **Experimental Procedure**

Sensory threshold set w/ 4, 2, 1 increase / decrease procedure

Visual perturbations = pseudo-random oscillations of visual field (citation 27, 28)

Middle 90s of 120/150s trials used

Foot positions marked with tape

### **Experimental Results and Discussion**

Effect of visual perturbations is greater in AP direction
