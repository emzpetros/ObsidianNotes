Finally, Virtual reality To assess plantar sensation’s effects in a real-word scenario, I intend to develop a crowd-walking task where the user is presented with virtual avatars as obstacles. Building this scenario in VR allows for an immersive and complex environment that realistically taxes motor planning while remaining safe.

  

  

Beyond characterizing cortical effects, we can design experiments with these participants representative of daily living tasks and asses the contribution of plantar sensation in commonplace, but complex activities. Furthermore,

.. Traditional laboratory assessments lack the variety of sensory input, aspect of divided attention, and unexpected interruptions of tasks in the real world. Conversely, VR worlds can be immersive complex, and dynamic.

  

  

Our lab has demonstrated integration of this sensation in higher level cortical processes [Kim] such as motor adaptation but we have not explored the mechanism beyond this interaction.  
Comparison between the intact and missing limb (with and without stimulation) provides a way to directly compare sensation’s effects).
