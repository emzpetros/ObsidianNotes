Title: Can sensory restoration reduce the mental effort of walking?

For many people walking is an activity we do every day.  It's such a practiced movement that we don't even think about it.  In reality, your brain is doing a ton of work to coordinate walking.  With every step, our nervous system is  integrating sensory information including sensation from the bottom of our feet.  Most times we don't appreciate this sensation but we are intuitively using it to stay steady .  

Now imagine you cannot feel your foot.  Before walking required hardly any thought, but now there are tons of questions in your head: Is the ground under my foot level?  Am I stepping on something slippery?  Am I going to lose my balance?  

This is the reality for individuals with lower limb amputations.  They cannot feel their prosthetic foot which makes every step uncertain.  Walking now requires a high level of attention.  This becomes an issue since we walk in highly dynamic environments.  There's cars, people, our phones...  Constant distractions that split our attention.  For individuals with limb loss, even a small diversion that takes the focus away from walking can lead to poor foot placement and a fall.

So in my research, I'm investigating if we can reduce this mental burden of walking.  I hypothesize that the brain is working overtime to compensate for the missing sensation from the foot.  So what happens if we restore sensation!

In order to do this, my lab implants small electrodes around the nerves that used to carry information from the individual's missing limb.  Then we send electrical pulses to the nerve through the electrodes.  These signals are interpreted by the brain as sensory input arising from the missing foot!  So when a participant steps with their prosthetic foot, they can feel it!

With this technology in place, I can assess it's effect on mental burden required by walking.  To do this, I conduct experiments where participants perform two tasks at once.  For example, walking on a treadmill while while memorizing a sequence of numbers.  Multitasking like this overwhelms our processing capacity and makes it harder to focus on walking.  Especially for this population where walking requires so much extra effort, this is the perfect setup to evaluate  the effect of restoring sensation.

I will run this experiment with sensation inactive and then active.  If performance improves, that would suggest having sensation reduces the mental burden of walking.

Studying this interaction could of course enhance our understanding of how sensory information influences mental processing.  But on an individual level, for those with lower limb loss, this knowledge could motivate the development of interventions using sensory restoration with the ultimate goal of making every step easier and safer.

- I can measure the effects of this divided attention by tracking performance measures such as walking speed and the number of errors in the memorization.  
- These signals can be easily processed because we're interacting with the body's natural communication systems.

Since walking itself requires attention, doing two tasks at once will reduce performance in one or both.  For example, their walking may be slower or mistakes may be made in the subtractions.

Did you do any walking today?  Did you have any problems with it?  Chances are you were walking around without even thinking about it.  Now imagine walking without being able to feel your foot.  This is the reality for individuals with lower limb amputations.  

Sensation from our feet is critical for controlling our walking.  With every step our nervous system is constantly integrating sensory information including tactile sensation from our feet.  With this information, we can react to something in our environment like a crack in the sidewalk and maintain our walking. 

For those without limb loss, this processing happens automatically and doesn't require dedicated focus.  But it's a different story for lower limb amputees who walk with a prosthesis as shown here

Without an intuitive sense of where their prosthetic foot is contacting the ground, they report having to focus on each and every step.  This extra mental demand can reduce confidence in their walking and make it harder to engage in daily activities.

My research delves into this mental burden of walking.  Specifically, can it be reduced by restoring sensation from the foot?  

To restore sensation, small electrodes are implanted around nerves that used to carry information from the individual's missing limb.  As shown in the yellow callout, we send small electrical pulses to the nerve that gets fed into the nervous system.  These signals are interpreted by the brain as sensory input arising from the foot.

With this technology I will run multitasking experiments designed to divide attention.  Participants will walk while performing a secondary task such repeatedly subtracting by 7's.  We have a limited amount of attention we can devote to tasks.  Since walking itself requires attention, doing two tasks at once will negatively affect performance.  For example, they walking may be slower or mistakes may be made in the subtractions.

This experiment will be run with restored sensation active and inactive.  If restored sensation reduces the mental effort of walking, then I would expect to see higher task performance when sensation is active.

Such an effect would shine a light on how sensation information affects a complex behavior like walking.  But more importantly, an intervention that restores sensation could  improve the quality of life for individuals with lower limb amputations by making every step easier.   
### D1
Walking is an activity many of us do everyday without even thinking.  But in fact, gait has both automatic and cognitively controlled components.  

Consider walking over uneven ground.  As part of gait, you process visual information about the path in front of you, vestibular input about your balance, and tactile sensation from your feet to know how steady your contact with the ground is.  Integrating all this information and then controlling your muscles to adjust to the complex environment requires cognitive attention.  

So walking imposes an attentional demand on us.  For an able-bodied individual, this demand is small.

However, for individuals with lower limb loss it is different. These individuals utilize a prosthesis to walk but this device provides no information about foot-to-floor interactions.  Without this sensation, individuals with lower limb amputations report having to devote extra attention to each and every step.  This uncertainty in walking can reduce confidence in their walking and make it harder for these people to engage in daily functional activities.

My research delves into how restoring this missing sensation affects the attentional demands of walking.     

To restore sensation, small electrodes are implanted around the nerves that used to carry information from the individual's missing foot.  By sending small electrical pulses to the nerve we can input signals into the nervous system that the brain interprets as sensation from the missing foot.

With this technology I will run multitasking experiments with restored sensation active and inactive.  In these experiments, I will have participants walk while performing a secondary task such as subtracting by 7's.  This forces them to split their attention.  As a result, I expect the performance in one or both tasks to decrease.  For example, they may walk slower or make mistakes in the subtractions.

I hypothesize that restored sensation will reduce the attentional burden of walking and result in higher task performance in these experiments.

Such an effect would shine a light on how sensation information affects a complex behavior like walking.  But more importantly, an intervention that restores sensation could then improve the quality of life for individuals with lower limb amputations by making every step easier.

In my lab’s previous work, we developed a sensory neuroprosthesis that as the name implies, restores sensations to the prosthetic limb by interacting with the body’s nervous system.  Imagine the nerves that used to connect to the missing foot are wires.  They are expecting electrical information that means “I’m putting pressure on my heel.”  We can recreate this input by sending small electrical pulses to electrodes around the nerves.  That information is carried to the brain as if it was a signal from the foot.  As a result, when a participant steps with the neuroprosthesis they feel sensation from their prosthetic foot.


My lab works with neural stimulation technology to restore this missing sensation.  For those with limb loss, the nerve fibers that used to connect to their missing foot are still intact in the thigh and leading up to the brain.  Think of it like a wire that can still carry information, but the electrical input is missing.    

We can recreate this input by implanting small electrodes around the remaining nerves.  Small electrical pulses to the nerve through these electrodes , travel up the nerve fiber and interpreted in the brain as sensation from the missing foot.  In this way, we restore sensation so when a participant steps on the toes of their prosthetic foot they feel pressure in the same area!

At some level, this processing occurs even when walking over flat ground.  Researchers have demonstrated this by having participants do dual-task experiments where they walk while performing a simultaneous secondary task. We have a limited amount of attention at any given time and doing two demanding tasks at once negatively impacts the performance of one or both.  For example, an individual may walk slower while talking on the phone than just walking alone.

The automatic side of gait is immediately familiar to us, you don't have to consciously think about moving your knee and ankle joints as you walk.  You can shift your weight from stride to stride and foot to foot without much mental effort.  These patterned responses are controlled by neural circuitries in your spinal cord and brainstem.  So for some aspects of gait you don't need your brain!

However,

As I am standing here now, I can feel the bottom of my feet on the ground and know that I am steady and balanced.  However, this sensation is compromised in individuals with lower limb loss.  They utilize a prosthesis to walk but this device provides no information about how the foot is interacting with the ground.  As a  result, walking and balance is more challenging.  Imagine navigating stairs without being able to feel the edge of the step. 

Without knowing where their prosthetic limb is in space, individuals with limb loss  report having to devote extra attention to every step they take.

As a  result, walking and balance is more challenging.  Imagine navigating stairs without being able to feel the edge of the step.

And it is true that walking is a mostly automatic process, 


So gait demands 

This speaks to a cognitive load that walking requires.  

My research delves into how restoring sensation impacts the higher mental demand of walking.  

My lab accomplishes sensory restoration with neural stimulation technology.  



In my thesis, using this technology, I can investigate how restoring sensation impacts the mental effort of walking.  To do this I will conduct dual-task experiments where participant perform two simultaneous tasks.  For example, walking and subtracting by 7’s.  Performing both tasks at once often overwhelms a person’s multitasking abilities.  So they may walk slower or subtract incorrectly.  I can run the experiment with the sensory neuroprosthesis active and inactive and see how having that restored sensation impacts the task performance. 

I hypothesize that the sensation will alleviate some of the mental burden walking usually requires.  Such an effect would shine a light on how sensation information affects a complex behavior like walking.  But more importantly, an intervention that restores sensation could then improve the quality of life for individuals with lower limb amputations by literally making every step easier.

This leads to lower confidence in walking, but can also contribute to people avoiding social activities.

Without sensation, walking requires more mental resources and it’s harder to cope with all the competing demands. 

but it is also harder to complete another simultaneous task.  For example, crossing the street requires you to focus visually on the walk sign, incoming cars, and maybe where the curb is if you’re jaywalking.  Scenarios like this can be seen in countless daily activities from grocery shopping to navigating your own home.

It is well established that walking is an automatic and centrally controlled process.  We can walk without thinking about moving each individual joint but we can also precisely control walking such as when hiking on uneven terrain.
